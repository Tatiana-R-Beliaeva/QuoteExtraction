Our results suggest that A. glandulosa may be able to cope with increases in air\\ntemperatures, however reductions in gsmay cause higher leaf temperatures beyond those induced by an air\\ntemperature rise over the coming century.\\n1. Introduction\\nGlobal atmospheric CO 2concentrations are increasing, as are air\\ntemperatures, with both patterns expected to continue in the coming\\ndecades.Plantsareacriticalpartofglobalbiogeochemicalcycles,atthe\\ninterface of the atmosphere and the land surface, with forests storing\\n65% of terrestrial aboveground biomass (Liu et al., 2015). Plants re-\\nspond to environmental stimuli, with long-term adaptation and short-\\nterm acclimation to changesin light, temperatureand otherconditions.\\nPhotosynthesis, evapotranspiration, and respiration are the primary\\nfunctions of leaves. Our understanding of leaf-level physiology is used\\ntodrivevegetationandlandsurfacemodels,andhencetoprojectfuture\\nclimate. Experimental research on the responses of forests to elevatedCO\\n2has been heavily focussed on temperate ecosystems (Leakey et al.,\\n2012) despitetropicalforestsstockingmorecarbonthantemperateandborealforestscombined(Panetal.,2011).Similarly,thereareveryfewstudies of thermal acclimation on tropical species (Dusenge and Way,\\n2017). Although temperature increases in the tropics are predicted to\\nbe smaller than in other regions (e.g. boreal zone, Collins et al., 2013),\\ntropical forests experience much lower diurnal and seasonal variationin temperature than temperate or boreal forests, and over geological\\ntime have experienced a relatively stable climate, potentially reducing\\nthe acclimation potential of tropical tree species (Janzen, 1967;\\nDusenge and Way, 2017). Investigating the responses of tropical tree\\nspecies to temperature and CO\\n2is therefore a research priority.\\nIncreasing air temperatures and atmospheric CO 2concentrations\\nlead to changes in stomatal conductance (g s) over short and long\\ntimescales (Way et al., 2015).

Evidence of acclimation of gsto higher\\ntemperatures in trees over the long-term is varied, however some spe-\\ncies show declines (Way et al., 2015). The instantaneous response of gs\\nto increased CO 2is to decrease, which reduces water loss while main-\\ntaining a high internal leaf CO 2concentration (c i) (Gaastra, 1959). Si-\\nmilarly,underlong-termCO 2enrichment, gsreduces.Suchdeclinesin gs\\nmay increase leaf temperature (T L) through reduced evaporative\\ncooling (underincreasedairtemperatures,reducedevaporative coolingwould also depend on the extent of increased D,Oren et al., 1999).\\nHigher T\\nLcould push leaves beyond their photosynthetic temperature\\noptima (T opt) (Doughty and Goulden, 2008; Slot and Winter, 2017c),\\nand potentially above their physiological temperature tolerances(O’Sullivan et al., 2017) causing permanent leaf damage under extreme\\nheat conditions (Warren et al., 2011). While the response of g\\nsto\\ncombined elevated CO 2(eC) and temperature (eT) has rarely been\\ntested (Way et al., 2015; Becklin et al., 2017), experiments on eu-\\ncalyptus (Ghannoum et al., 2010), douglas-fir (Lewis et al., 2002) andloblolly pine (Wertin et al., 2010) showed little interactive effect; if the\\ntwo do interact and lead to even greater decreases in g\\ns, this would\\nincrease TLfurther.\\nLong-term increasing air temperatures and CO 2concentrations are\\nalsopredictedtoinducechangesinnet photosynthesis,bothdirectlybyimpacting biochemical processes and indirectly through changes in g\\ns.\\nIncreases in TLeither directly from increased air temperatures or in-\\ndirectlyfromalong-termreductionin gscouldshifttheleafbeyond Topt,\\nleading to reductions in photosynthesis. Some experimental studieshave shown partial photosynthetic acclimation to increasing tempera-\\ntures through increases in T\\nopt(Yamori et al., 2014; Slot and Winter,\\n2017b), which could occur due to alterations in membrane fluidity,expression of heat shock proteins, and production of greater quantities\\nof Rubisco activase or a heat-stable Rubisco activase (Yamori et al.,\\n2014). These changes would lead to altered temperature responses of\\nthe photosynthetic capacities V\\ncmax(maximum rate of carboxylation)\\nandJmax(maximum rate of electron transport). A recent study of four\\ntropicaltreespeciesshowedthat gsratherthan VcmaxorJmaxlimitednet\\nphotosynthesis beyond Topt(Slot and Winter, 2017a), and hence a\\nchange to the temperature (or D) response of gscould also be important\\nfor shifts in Topt. Photosynthetic capacities are also influenced by\\ngrowth CO 2concentrations. Under high CO 2, Rubisco concentrations\\ntypically reduce and hence Vcmaxdeclines (Way et al., 2015). Decreases\\nings(as a consequence of increased air temperature or CO 2) lead to\\nreduced ciwhich can reduce assimilation.

However, this\\neffect has not been investigated in any tropical species. Furthermore,\\nbecause TLand, to a lesser extent, gsshow high temporal variation with\\nchanging microclimate (e.g. Fausetetal.,2018),to fullyinvestigatethe\\neffect of altered gsas a response to elevated temperature and CO 2it is\\nnecessary to measure TLand microclimate with a high temporal re-\\nsolution.\\nInthisstudy,weaddressthefollowingquestionsusingafactorialeT\\nx eC open top chamber experiment with juveniles of tropical tree spe-\\nciesAlchornea glandulosa (Poepp. & Endl) (Euphorbiaceae): i) To what\\nextent does gsreduce with elevated temperature (eT) and elevated CO 2\\n(eC)treatments?;ii)IsthereaninteractiveeffectofeTandeCon gs?;iii)\\nDoes reduced gsas a result of eT and/or eC cause an increase in TL?; iv)\\nDo the photosynthetic temperature optima (T opt) and temperatureresponseofphotosyntheticcapacities(V cmax,Jmax)shiftwithhigherleaf\\ntemperatures? A. glandulosa is a pioneer species often found, but not\\nrestricted to, riverine environments (Pascotto, 2006), distributed in the\\nAtlantic forest, western Amazon/Andes and central America (GBIF\\nSecretariat, 2017), with over 100,000,000 individual trees estimated to\\noccur in the Amazon (ter Steege et al., 2013). It is utilized as a timber\\nspecies, produces medicinal compounds and is used for reforestation in\\nthe Atlantic forest region. The fruits of this tree are an important food\\nsourceforbirds(Pascotto,2006).Thisspecieswasalsoselectedbecause\\nleaf temperature and stomatal conductance field data for congeneric\\nspecies Alchornea triplinervia were available from the Atlantic forest\\n(Fauset et al., 2018).\\n2. Methods\\n2.1. Experimental setup\\nThe study was carried out at the University of São Paulo from\\nFebruary to March 2017 (23.56°S, 46.73°W, elevation 760m).\\nAlchornea glandulosa seedlings were sourced from a local plant nursery\\nwhere they were germinated in shade houses before growing for 12months outside.\\nTheseedlings weremoved to the glasshousein September 2016 and\\ninNovembertransferredintocontainers(4l PVCpotswithoneplantper\\nplot). Hoagland fertilizer solution was added every 2 weeks. The ex-periment was conducted using four polycarbonate open top chambers\\n(OTCs) with modifications (Aidar et al., 2002) located within the glass\\nhouse. The four treatments were: i) control (aTaC), ii) elevated CO\\n2\\n(ambient temperature, 800ppm CO 2, aTeC), iii) elevated temperature\\n(temperature 1.5°C above ambient, ambient CO 2, eTaC), and iv) ele-\\nvated CO 2and elevated temperature (temperature 1.5°C above am-\\nbient, 800ppm CO 2,eTeC). Each chamber had an air inlet at the base\\nwith a fan, and a spiral heater and/or CO 2gas inlet was present de-\\npending onthetreatment(FigureS1). Temperaturewithin thechamberwas thermostatically controlled using RICS software (Remote In-\\ntegratedControlSystem)withtheheaterswitchedonorofftomaintain\\na higher temperature than the unheated chambers. No attempt was\\nmade to control for differences in Ddue to temperature treatments as\\nincreases in temperature would be associated with increases in Dunder\\nfuture conditions assuming no change in relative humidity. CO\\n2was\\npassivelyaddedtotheeCtreatmentsthroughtheuseofpressurizedCO 2\\ncylinders. The CO 2concentrations of the eC chambers was monitored\\ndaily and the flow into the chambers altered at a valve if the con-\\ncentration decreased. Further details of the experimental design can be\\nfound in Aidar et al., 2002 andde Souza et al. (2008). Ten seedlings\\nwere placed into each chamber on 1 February 2017 and allowed to\\nacclimateforonemonthbeforemeasurementsbegan.Verticalheightof\\neach seedling was recorded prior to placement in the OTCs, and pla-\\ncementofseedlingsintoOTCswasstratifiedtoensureanevenspreadof\\nvertical heights.\\n2.2. Microclimate measurements\\nWithin each OTC air temperature (T A), relative humidity (h) and\\nCO2concentration were measured at 5min intervals (Testo 535, Testo\\nInc., Flanders, NJ, USA). An additional TAsensor (107 thermistor,\\nCampbell Scientific) recorded air temperature every 10s inside each\\nchamber.\\n2.3. Physiological measurements\\n2.3.1. Leaf temperature and leaf surface PAR\\nThe eight healthiest of the ten seedlings in each chamber were se-\\nlected for measurement of leaf temperature.

Environmental and Experimental Botany 158 (2019) 28–39\\n29to movement of the seedling into the OTCs. Prior to selection, we\\nverified that the leaves were photosynthetically active. A two-junction\\nthermocouple (copper-constantan, type T) that measured leaf-to-air\\ntemperature difference (ΔT L) was attached to the abaxial surface of\\neach sample leaf using a piece of breathable tape (Transpore, 3M, St.Paul MN) following the protocol of Fauset et al. (2018). One thermo-\\ncouple was used per leaf. Absolute leaf temperatures (T\\nL) were calcu-\\nlated from ΔTLandTAin each chamber measured by the thermistors. A\\nphotosynthetically active radiation (PAR) sensor built to the specifica-tion ofFielder and Comeau (2000) was positioned adjacent to each\\nsample leaf at the same angle and orientation. PAR sensors were cali-brated against a quantum sensor (LightScout, Spectrum Technologies,\\nAurora,Illinois). ΔT\\nLandleafsurfacePARweremonitoredcontinuously\\nat 10s measuring frequency between 24 February – 15 March 2017\\nusing two CR800 data loggers and two AM16/32 multiplexers (Camp-\\nbell Scientific). Measurements of some leaves were terminated between\\n10 and 15 March. See Fauset et al. (2017), (2018)for further details of\\nthese sensors.\\n2.3.2.

Photosynthetic measurements\\nThe temperature response of photosynthesis was measured using a\\nLI-COR 6400XT portable photosynthesis measurement system (LI-COR,\\nNebraska). Data were collected from 10 to 18 March 2018. Light re-\\nsponse curves on 3 leaves showed saturating photosynthesis at\\n800μmolm\\n−2s-1PAR (Figure S2), hence all measurements were taken\\nat 800μmolm−2s-1PAR using the standard red-blue LED light source.\\nNote that the glasshouse roof was made of a diffusing plastic which\\nreduced the incoming PAR by c. 60% compared with the outside, and\\nleaf level PAR reached c. 800μmolm−2s-1, varying with leaf angleand\\norientation. Three seedlings from each OTC were selected for photo-synthesis measurements and the leaf measurements were performed on\\nthe same leaf as leaf temperature monitoring. Two sets of measure-\\nments were made, net photosynthesis-temperature curves (A-T\\nLcurves\\nwhere net photosynthesis at saturating light intensity is measured atdifferent temperatures), and A-c\\nicurves (where net photosynthesis at\\nsaturating light intensity is measured at different CO 2concentrations)\\nat three different temperatures. A-Tcurves were run with the CO 2\\nconcentration of the relevant OTC (either 400 of 800ppm CO 2) and\\nassimilation was measured at leaf chamber temperatures of 20, 25, 27,\\n29, 31, 33, 35 and 40°C, with 5 measurements recorded at each tem-\\nperature after the photosynthetic rate and gshad stabilized.\\nMeasurements at 20, 30 and 35°C were supplemented using the re-levant measurements from the A-c\\nicurves. A-cicurves used the fol-\\nlowing sequence of CO 2concentrations (ppm); 400, 200, 100, 50, 400,\\n600, 800, 1200, 1500, 2000. A-cicurves were performed at three\\ntemperatures, 20, 30, and 35°C, and each curve was performed twicefor each leaf on either side of the midrib. For all measurements, hwas\\nmaintainedascloseaspossibleto50%usingacombinationofdesiccantand adjusting the air flow rate; it was difficult to maintain this hat leaf\\ntemperatures above 37°C (on average 46%, minimum values were40%). The temperature of the chamber was mostly controlled using theinbuilt temperature control system. In addition, for most of the mea-\\nsurements the sensor head was placed inside a specially designed\\ntemperature control chamber to enable better control of the chamber\\ntemperature (Yepes Mayorga, 2010). The temperature control box was\\nswitched off during measurements but was used to aid the change of\\nchamber temperature between measurements. Measurements weremade at an atmospheric pressure in the greenhouse of 92.6kPa.\\n2.3.4. Plant growth\\nVertical height (from soil surface) and number of leaves of each\\nseedling was measured three times (1 and 21 February, and 16 March).\\nOnthelattertwomeasurementdays,thelengthoftheseedlingfromthe\\nsoil surface to the end of the longest branch was also recorded, and on\\n16 March the total plant length including all branches was recorded.\\n2.4. Data analysis\\nAll raw data generated in this study are freely available through\\nMendeley Data.\\nDifferences in microclimate between OTCs (air temperature, CO\\n2\\nconcentration, handD) were tested using ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc\\ntest.\\nThe effects of the warming and the elevated CO 2treatments on gs\\n(porometer measurements pooled from all times of day) were tested\\nusing two-way ANOVA with a mixed effects model with leaf as a\\nrandomfactortoaccountformultiplemeasurementsofthesameleaves\\n(function ‘lme’ of the R package nlme, Pinheiro et al., 2017). To in-\\nvestigate the response of gsto microclimate variables and under dif-\\nferent treatments, all possible models of PAR and leaf-to-air vapour\\npressure deficit DL(where leaf temperature was taken from thermo-\\ncouple data), with interactions with CO 2treatment and warming\\ntreatment were compared using AIC to select the best model with the\\nfunction ‘dredge’ in R package MuMIn (Barton, 2016). Again, a linearmixedeffectmodelwithleafasarandomfactorwasusedtoaccountfor\\nmultiple measurements of the same leaf/seedling.

We\\nsubsetted the data into envelopes based on leaf-level PAR, chamber airtemperature and D. The data was split into low (100–200μmolm\\n−2s-\\n1), medium (400–500μmolm−2s-1) and high (700–800μmolm−2s-1)\\nPAR, and low (28–30°C, 1–2kPa), medium (33–35°C, 2–3kPa), and\\nhigh(38–40°C,3–4kPa)airtemperatureand D.Anunanticipatedeffect\\noftheswitchingonandoffoftheheaterinthewarmedchamberswasacycle in leaf temperature. This was particularly clear at night, but also\\noccurred during the day. When the heater was switched on, the ΔT\\nL\\nbecame more negative as the air heated fasterthan the leaf (Figure S3).\\nThe ΔTLthen rose to reach an equilibrium temperature. Because of this\\ncycle in the ΔTLdata, it was not possible to compare leaf temperatures\\ndirectly between the ambient and heated chambers, and hence direct\\ncomparisons on ΔTLwere only made between CO 2treatments within\\ntemperature treatments.\\nThetemperatureresponseofphotosynthesisistypicallymodelledas\\na parabolic curve which provides a Toptparameter (e.g. Robakowski\\net al., 2012). However, as no evidence of a decline of Awith increasingS. Fauset et al. Environmental and Experimental Botany 158 (2019) 28–39\\n30TLwas found (see section 3.4), we could not use the parabolic curve to\\nfindTopt(Figure S4) which was beyond the range of our measurements.\\nHence, a linear mixed effect model with leaf as a random factor was\\nused to test the relationship between AandTL. As for stomatal con-\\nductance we selected the best model based on AIC from all possiblemodels, here including T\\nLas a continuous fixed effect and interactions\\nwith CO 2treatment and warming treatment.\\nVcmaxandJmaxwere estimated for each leaf and each temperature\\nfrom the A-cicurve using the Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry model\\nusing the R package plantecophys (Duursma, 2015). For some curves\\n(sixfor Jmaxandonefor Vcmax,allat20°C),theparameterscouldnotbe\\nadequately estimated and estimates were not used. Of the remainingfits, the root mean square error ranged 0.18–1.57μmolm\\n−2s-1. The\\ntemperature responses of VcmaxandJmaxwere modelled using the Ar-\\nrhenius function (Medlyn et al., 2002)\\n= f T k expE T\\nRT( )( 298)\\n(298 )ka k\\nk25\\nwherek25is the value of VcmaxorJmaxat 25°C, Eais the activation\\nenergy(kJmol−1),Tkistheleaftemperature(°K)andRistheuniversal\\ngas constant (8.314J mol−1K−1). The parameters were fit using non-\\nlinear least squares (R function nls). This function was fit separately for\\neach chamber, and significant differences in parameter estimates were\\ntested by comparing the 95% confidence intervals (following\\nVårhammar et al., 2015). A peaked Arrhenius function was not used as\\nthe data did not show a decline in VcmaxorJmaxat high temperatures.\\n3. Results\\n3.1. Microclimate over the study period\\nThe experimental period coincided with an anomalously hot\\nsummerinSãoPaulocityincludinga4dayheatwave(Fig.1).Usingthe\\ndefinition of a heatwave from Russo et al. (2015) as ≥3 consecutive\\ndays where the maximum temperature exceeds the 90th percentile of\\nmaximum temperatures from a monthly window for the period\\n1981–2010, and climate data for the Mirante de Santana weather sta-\\ntion (INMET), a four day heatwave period occurred (maximum tem-\\nperatures above 32.3°C) in mid-February (Fig. 1, Figure S5). The\\nheatwave occurred during the acclimation period but before the in-\\nitiation of data collection. During this time the maximum daily air\\ntemperatures within the OTCs exceeded 45°C (Fig. 1).\\nMean daily temperatures within the OTCs over the acclimation andmeasurement periods were significantly different between chambers(F=5.4,P= 0.001,ANOVA, Fig.2a).Temperaturesweresignificantly\\nlower in the aTeC treatment (28.8 ± 2.3°C mean ± SD) than theeTeC treatment (30.4 ± 2.3°C), however the difference between aTaC\\n(29.0 ± 2.2°C)andeTaC(30.3 ± 2.4°C)wasmarginallyinsignificant\\n(P= 0.07, Tukey post-hoc test, Fig. 1a). Mean daily CO\\n2concentration\\nwas significantly higher in the aTeC and eTeC treatments(829.9 ± 71.6ppm and 836.7 ± 70.6ppm,respectively, Fig.1b) than\\nthe ambient CO\\n2treatments, however the concentration in the eTaC\\nchamber (399.0 ± 8.9ppm) was significantly lower than the aTaC\\nchamber (459.2 ± 12.2ppm). Relative humidity also varied by treat-\\nment with lower values in the elevated CO 2treatments (Fig. 2c), and D\\nwashigherinelevatedtemperaturetreatments,significantlysoforeTeC(Fig. 2d).\\n3.2.

The\\noverall pseudo marginal R2of the model was 0.38.

We mea-\\nsured the physiological responses on leaves formed before initiation of\\nthe experiment, which had been exposed to the treatments for c. 5\\nweeks. As stomatal properties (e.g. density) often differ on leaves\\nformed in high CO 2environments (Saxe et al., 1998), there could po-\\ntentially be greater changes than we observed, had new leaves formed.Whilst this is quite possible, the long-term response of g\\nsto CO2is ty-\\npically similar to the short term response (Way et al., 2015), and hencewhile the mechanism of reduced g\\nsmay be different in short and long-\\nterm studies, the gsmay be similar. However, a caveat to our results is\\nthat to truly observe the acclimation of leaves to the treatments, longeracclimation periods and production of new leaves is necessary.\\nThe observed responses of g\\nsto elevated temperature varyconsiderably in the few studies available (Way et al., 2015). Here wefind strong reductions in g\\nsin the temperature treatments with a 49.6%\\n(95% CI 42.2–56.5 %) reduction under the eTaC treatment and 53.0%(95% CI 52.9–58.3 %) reduction in the combined eTeC treatment, al-\\nthough we did not find any significant difference between treatments\\nfor the g\\n1parameter value. This may be because the Medlyn et al.\\n(2011)model incorporates the ambient CO 2concentration, and if the\\nshort-termandlongterm gsresponsetoCO 2isthesametherewouldnot\\nbe a difference. The declines in gsare not driven purely by higher DLin\\nthe eT chambers as there are significant differences even when DLis\\ncontrolled for (Table 1, Fig. 4) or when gsis analysed within a narrow\\nDLrange (data not shown). This shows acclimation of gsdue to higher\\nair temperature and/or DL(both quantities strongly co-varied) which\\nwill reduce water loss from the plants. There were no significant dif-ferences in g\\nsbetween the eTaC and eTeC treatments, hence the re-\\nsponse to the temperature treatment (with significant differences) was\\nFig.6.Diurnal cycles of leaf-to-air temperature difference (a,b), leaf temperature (c,d), PAR (e,f), D(g,h), for chambers with ambient air temperature (a,c,e,g) and\\nelevated temperatures (b,d,f,h).

An experimental study of gas exchange of Solanum lycopersicum\\n(cherry tomato) measured during and following a +14°C heatwave\\nshowed reduced gsduring the heatwave, which remained low when\\nmeasured 5 days after the heatwave (Duan et al., 2016). Similarly,Duarte et al. (2016) found reduced g\\nsofPseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas\\nfir) during +12°C heatwaves which remained when measured one\\nmonth later. This is somewhat in contrast with recent research sug-\\ngesting stomata remain open under very high air temperatures for in-\\ncreased evaporative cooling (Slot et al., 2016; Slot and Winter, 2017b;\\nUrban et al., 2017; Drake et al., 2018). Responses are likely to be\\nspecies specific,with anexampleofalatesuccessionalspeciesreducing\\ngsunderheatwaveconditionswhileapioneerspeciesshowedincreased\\ngs(Vargas and Cordero, 2013). However these studies are assessing the\\ninstantaneous response of gsto short-term warming rather than the\\nlong-termresponse.Afieldstudyreportingtheimpactoffourmonthsofexperimentally elevated temperature on g\\nsof existing leaves showed a\\nc. 25% reduction with 2°C temperature increase averaged across sixtropical species (Doughty, 2011), lower than we observed.

Other studies with a\\ncongeneric species show that gsofA. triplinervia is more weakly linked\\ntoDLthan other measured species (García-Núñez et al., 1995; Fauset\\net al., 2018). A weaker relationship between gsandDLis expected for\\nlow wood density pioneer species compared to species with higherwood density (Lin et al., 2015). In addition, as the species is commonly\\nfound in riparian areas (and therefore with access to a good water\\nsupply), its lack of stomatal control is not surprising. Our results show\\nthat despite a weak instantaneous response of g\\nsto microclimate, A.\\nglandulosa still showed acclimation and reduction in gsin response to\\nlong-term microclimate change. Hence, the short-term response of gs\\ndoes not provide information on the long-term response.\\n4.2. CO 2impacts on leaf temperature\\nThe lower gsas a result of elevated CO 2caused increases in leaf\\ntemperatures (Fig. 5). The differences in ΔTLincreased with increasing\\nPAR at the leaf surface, and to a lesser extent with increasing air tem-\\nperatureand D.Thisshowsthatthedifferencesinleaftemperaturesdue\\nto CO2-altered gsare more apparent under high thermal stress condi-\\ntions (high PAR and high air temperature), and therefore that this im-\\npact is likely to be stronger under heat waves, which are expected to\\nincrease in frequency during the 21st century (Coumou and Robinson,\\n2013).Whenathighairtemperatures,differencesin ΔTLduetoreduced\\ngscould have significant consequences, as seen in observations of pre-\\nmature leaf senescence during a heatwave in a temperate FACE ex-\\nperiment (Warren et al., 2011). While the average differences in ΔTL\\nbetween aTaC and aTeC reached 2.8°C under high light and air tem-\\nperature, the light conditions were limited by the greenhouse en-\\nvironment which reached only 1000μmolm−2s-1.

Temperature and CO 2impacts on photosynthesis\\nThe elevated temperature treatment had no discernible effect on A\\nor photosynthetic capacity and their responses to elevated tempera-tures. The high temperature tolerance of both Aand photosynthetic\\ncapacity was marked, with no decline in Afound even at 40°C.\\nConsequently,wewerenotabletoassessshiftsin T\\noptwithtreatmentas\\nToptwas above the maximum temperature under which we performed\\nmeasurements. It is worth noting that such high leaf temperatures are\\noften considered to be detrimental to photosynthetic functions (e.g.\\nRubisco activase activity is strongly temperature sensitive with inhibi-\\ntion found above 35°C [Crafts-Brandner and Salvucci, 2000]). More-\\nover, photosystem II (PSII) activity declines rapidly above temperature\\nthresholdsof41.5–50.8°C(O’Sullivanetal.,2017).However,plantsare\\nwell adapted to their environment, with temperature thresholds of PSII\\nincreasing from arctic to tropical habitats (O’Sullivan et al., 2017), and\\neven increasing thermal tolerance of PSII over very short timescales\\n(days) in response to high temperatures (Drake et al., 2018). Slot et al.\\n(2017c)foundthat ToptmeasuredinthefieldinPanamawasaroundthe\\nmean maximum daily temperature (30–32°C) for all 42 species mea-\\nsured, and that, for a smaller sample of four species, it was gsrather\\nthan Rubisco activase, Jmax,Vcmaxor light respiration that limited the\\nphotosynthetic rates at high temperatures (Slot and Winter, 2017a). In\\nanother study, Toptwas higher than daily maximum air temperature in\\nmoist and wet tropical forest sites in Puerto Rico (Mau et al., 2018). Inthe case of the A. glandulosa seedlings measured here, the mean max-\\nimum daily temperature over the acclimation and measurement periodwas 40–42°C (varying by treatment, Fig. 1), matching the minimum\\npotential T\\noptof 40°C, and showing tolerance to the high temperatures\\nto which they were exposed. Measurement under higher temperatures\\nwould be necessary to find the Toptfor these plants. Over the measured\\ntemperaturerange, gs,VcmaxandJmaxdidnotdecline.Yet,itshouldalso\\nbenotedthattheratesof A,VcmaxandJmaxwerefairlylow(c.3,40and\\n35μmolm−2s-1respectively, at the highest values and under ambient\\nCO2).Forexample,thesearelowerthan Aof12–16μmolm−2s-1across\\n42Panamanianspecies(SlotandWinter,2017c)and5–12μmolm−2s-1\\nfor four species in Puerto Rico (Mau et al., 2018), and Vcmaxof\\n70–300μmolm−2s-1andJmaxof 80–220μmolm−2s-1across four Pa-\\nnamanian species (Slot and Winter, 2017a), all at their optimum tem-\\nperatures. The measured rates are also lower than plants in other high\\ntemperature environments e.g. five desert species with Aranging\\n19–35μmolm−2s-1(Mooneyetal.,1981),and Mediterraneancorkoak\\nwithVcmaxandJmaxboth over 150μmolm−2s-1(Ghouil et al., 2003).\\nThus, high temperature tolerance of photosynthetic machinery in A.\\nglandulosa may come at a cost of lower photosynthetic rates. An alter-\\nnative explanation for the low photosynthetic rates is the low lightconditions within the greenhouse, with maximum leaf surface PAR of\\n800–1000μmolm\\n−2s-1.Inthefield,maximumPARislikelytobemuch\\nhigher (>2000μmolm−2s-1), and leaves may achieve higher photo-\\nsynthetic rates. The low light conditions in the greenhouse also have\\nimplications for the high temperature tolerance observed. Because at\\nhigh temperatures photosynthetic biochemistry is under greater stress,\\nthere is a greater need for photoprotection from high incoming radia-\\ntion. Perhaps under the higher light conditions found in the field, very\\nhigh temperature tolerance of photosynthesis may be more difficult to\\nachieve. Field studies under high temperature conditions are needed to\\nestablish whether the high tolerance we find here also occurs under\\nnatural conditions.\\nAs forgs, the impacts of increased CO 2followed expectations fromprevious studies with increased net photosynthesis when measured at\\ngrowth CO 2, a steeper slope of Ain response to temperature, and\\ndownregulation of photosynthetic capacity (Fig. 8,9). The steeper slopeis duetothereduction inoxygenationofRubiscodueto higher c\\niunder\\nelevated CO 2, which otherwise increases with temperature due to the\\nreduced affinity of Rubisco for CO 2with higher temperature (Long,\\n1991). The effect of the downregulation can be seen when the tem-perature response of Ais plotted with added points taken from the A-c\\ni\\ncurves at 400 and 800ppm CO 2for the elevated and ambient CO 2\\ntreatments respectively, showing that without the downregulation of\\nphotosynthetic capacity Awould have been higher in the elevated CO 2\\ntreatment (Figure S9).\\n4.4. Conclusions\\nThis study demonstrates that the tropical tree species Alchornea\\nglandulosa shows strong responses of stomatal conductance to elevated\\ntemperatureandofphotosyntheticparameterstoelevatedCO 2.Whilea\\nvery high temperature tolerance of photosynthesis was observed in this\\nspecies, photosynthetic rates were low under the high growth tem-\\nperatures. These results show that this species will be able to cope with\\nthe predicted atmospheric changes over the coming century.Therefore,\\nit is an appropriate species for reforestation activities, which are\\nplanned and ongoing in the Atlantic forest (Rodrigues et al., 2009).\\nMorestudies ofotherspeciesarerequiredtodetermine whethersimilar\\nresults occur in other forest trees.\\nAuthorstatement\\nSophie Fauset: Conceptualization, Formal Analysis, Investigation,\\nWriting – Original Draft, Lauana Oliveira: Investigation, Writing –\\nReview & Editing, Marcos Buckeridge: Resources, Conceptualization,\\nWriting – Review & Editing, Christine H.

In  addition  to  resource  limitations,\\nplant  communities  have  to  deal  with  anthropogenic  stressors  such\\nas  acid  rain,  or  organic  and  inorganic  pollutants  like  pesticides  or\\nheavy  metals.  Indeed,  metal  toxicity  limits  plant  growth  in  many\\nareas  affected  by  mining  or  smelting  activities,  sewage  sludge  depo-\\nsition  or  trafﬁc  (Kabata-Pendias  and  Pendias,  2001;  Arienzo  et  al.,\\n2004 ).\\nPredicting  future  plant  responses  to  the  ongoing  increase  in\\nfrequency  and  intensity  of  droughts  (IPCC,  2007 )  requires  a  mech-\\nanistic  understanding  of  how  plants  cope  with  drought  stress\\nunder  conditions  of  elevated  atmospheric  CO 2concentrations  and\\nwarmer  temperatures.  Besides  climate  related  stressors,  this  also\\nholds  for  future  responses  to  natural  stressors  like  nutrient  limita-\\ntion  or  anthropogenic  stressors  like  heavy  metal  pollution,  which  is\\nwhy  multifactorial  experiments  are  often  called  for  (Norby  and  Luo,\\n2004;  Mittler,  2006 ).  Nonetheless,  ﬁeld  studies  of  stress  responses\\nunder  combined  elevated  CO 2and  warming  remain  very  scarce\\n(Casella  et  al.,  1996;  Dukes  et  al.,  2005;  Mikkelsen  et  al.,  2008;  Bloor\\net  al.,  2010 ).\\nSingle  factor  studies,  on  the  other  hand,  have  been  fre-\\nquently  reported,  especially  the  effects  of  elevated  CO 2.

All  other  effects  of  elevated  CO 2on  plants  and  ecosys-\\ntems  are  derived  from  these  changes  (Long  et  al.,  2004 ).  Also  the\\neffect  of  single  warming  or  elevated  CO 2on  one  environmental\\nstressor  has  been  reported  in  the  literature.  For  example,  elevated\\nCO 2can  moderate  water  shortages  during  drought  through  its\\neffect  on  stomatal  conductance  (Rogers  et  al.,  1984 ),  while  warming\\ncan  cause  reduced  water  availability  due  to  increased  evapotrans-\\npiration  (Loik  et  al.,  2000 ).  Future  climate  conditions  may  also  affect\\nthe  availability  of  N.  Increased  carbon  (C)  input  under  elevated  CO 2\\nis  found  to  decrease  soil  N  availability  through  enhanced  micro-\\nbial  immobilization  (Luo  et  al.,  2004;  Hu  et  al.,  2006 ),  eventually\\nleading  to  N  limitation  (Oren  et  al.,  2001;  Hungate  et  al.,  2003;  Luo\\net  al.,  2004 ).  However,  increasing  soil  temperatures  could  reverse\\nthis  reduction  in  N  availability,  by  enhancing  net  N  mineralization\\n(Loiseau  and  Soussana,  2000;  Hovenden  et  al.,  2008 ).  Enhanced\\nmineralization  could also alter  heavy  metal  availability  if  the  metals\\nare  bound  to  soil  organic  matter  (Antoniadis  and  Alloway,  2001 ).\\nHence, it is  clear  that  a  future  climate  can  change  the  intensity\\nof  stress  factors  by  decreasing  or  increasing  the  availabilities  of\\nresources and/or pollutants.\\nRegardless  of  a  possible  impact  on  the  intensity  of  a  stressor,\\na changing climate  could  also  affect  the  plant’s  protective  capac-\\nity  and,  as  a  consequence,  their  growth  responses  to  stress.  As  a\\nresult  of  stress-induced  perturbations  in  plant  metabolism,  lev-\\nels  of  reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS)  generally  increase  (Mittler,\\n2002 ).  The  production  of  ROS  during  stress  results  from  imbalances\\nin  pathways  such  as  photorespiration,  from  the  photosynthetic\\napparatus  and  from  mitochondrial  respiration.  In  addition,  envi-\\nronmental  stress  has  been  shown  to  trigger  the  active  production\\nof  ROS  by  NADPH  oxidases  (Knight  and  Knight,  2001 ).  Reactive  oxy-\\ngen  species  can  act  as  signals  for  the  activation  of  stress  response\\nand  defence  pathways,  but  they  can  also  be  harmful  for  biological\\nstructures  and  processes,  and  can  lead  to  DNA,  amino  acid  and  pro-\\ntein  oxidation  and  lipid  peroxidation  (Asada,  1999 ).  To  circumvent\\nthe  deleterious  effects  of  ROS,  plants  have  evolved  robust  antioxi-\\ndant  defensive  systems  to  minimize  free  radicals  damage  (Mittler\\net  al.,  2004 ).  Interestingly,  oxidative  stress  and  antioxidant  systems\\nmay be  altered  in  a  future  climate.  Yet,  the  effect  of  combined  ele-\\nvated  CO 2and  warming  on  stress-relief  mechanisms  has  received\\nlittle  attention  (Aranjuelo  et  al.,  2008 ).  Single  elevated  CO 2can\\ndiminish  intrinsic  oxidative  stress  through  decreased  ROS  forma-\\ntion,  resulting  from  an  enhanced  use  of  reductant  for  assimilation\\nin  photosynthesis  and  a  reduced  photorespiration  (Halliwell  and\\nGutteridge,  1989;  Schwanz  and  Polle,  1998 ).  Consequently,  a  down-\\nregulation  of  the  protective  mechanisms  by  elevated  CO 2has  been\\nreported  in  several  studies  (Schwanz  and  Polle,  1998;  Vurro  et  al.,\\n2009 ).  Another  observed  effect  of  elevated  CO 2occurs  prior  to  any\\nphotooxidative  process  and  operates  through  an  enhanced  thermal\\ndissipation  of  excessive  energy  (nonphotochemical  quenching),\\nresulting  in  an  improved  photoprotection  (Aranjuelo  et  al.,  2008 ).\\nFurthermore,  also  moderate  warming  can  contribute  to  alleviating\\noxidative  stress  through  an  enhancement  of  metabolic  reactions\\n(Han  et  al.,  2009 ).\\nGrasslands  cover  15%  of  the  European  land  area  and  are\\nan  important  food  source  for  livestock  (Ciais  et  al.,  2010 ).  An\\nunderstanding  of  potential  stress-induced  reductions  in  biomass\\nproduction  is  thus  relevant,  both  now  and  under  changing  cli-\\nmate  conditions.  In  the  present  study  we  have  determined  how\\ngrassland  communities  respond  to  a  variety  of  stressors  in  a  future\\nclimate  at  both  the  cellular  and  the  community  level.  Hence,  this\\nstudy  responds  to  the  need  for  research  that  relates  molecular\\ninformation  to  whole  plant  processes  (Chaves  et  al.,  2003 ).  The\\nexperimental set-up  contained  realistically  assembled  grassland\\ncommunities  that  were  grown  under  a  current  and  a  projectedfuture  climate,  and  subjected  to  drought,  N  limitation,  Zn  toxicity\\nand  their  combinations.  We  hypothesize  that  combined  elevated\\nCO 2and  warming  ameliorates  plant  protection  against  stress  and\\nthat  this  increased  protection  mitigates  the  decline  in  grassland\\nproductivity  in  response  to  stress.\\n2.  Materials  and  methods\\n2.1.  Experimental  set-up\\nThe  study  was  performed  on  assembled  grassland  communities\\nat  the  Drie  Eiken  Campus,  University  of  Antwerp,  Wilrijk,  Belgium\\n(51◦09/primeN,  04◦24/primeE,  10  asl).  Average  annual  precipitation  at  this\\nlocation  is  776  mm,  average  annual  air  temperature  is  around\\n10.8◦C.  The  experimental  set-up  consisted  of  six  sunlit,  south\\nfacing  climate-controlled  chambers.  The  interior  surface  area  was\\n1.5 m  ×  1.5  m,  the  height  at  the  north  side  1.5  m  and  at  the  south\\nside  1.2 m. The top  of  the  chambers  consisted  of  a  colourless\\npolycarbonate plate  (4  mm  thick),  whereas  the  sides  were  made  of\\npolyethylene  ﬁlm (200 /H9262m  thick),  both  UV  transparent.  Three  of  the\\nsix  chambers  tracked  the  current  climate  with  current  air  temper-\\nature  (Tair)  and  CO 2concentration,  while  the  other  three  chambers\\nwere  exposed  to  a  future  climate  scenario  with  3◦C  warming  and  a\\ntarget  CO 2concentration  of  620.  We  further  refer  to  these  climate\\nscenarios  as  ‘current’  and  ‘future  climate’,  respectively,  although  it\\nis  recognized  that  future  climate  conditions  as  predicted  by  the  IPCC\\nalso  include  other  aspects  such  as  changes  in  precipitation  and  wind\\npatterns,  more  frequent  extreme  events  and  increased  emissions\\nof  aerosols,  methane  and  nitrous  oxide  (IPCC,  2007 ).  The  CO 2con-\\ncentration  was  measured  and  regulated  with  a  CO 2control  group\\nwith  an  infrared  analyser  (WMA-4,  PPSystems,  Hitchin,  UK).  In  the\\ncurrent  climate  chambers  the  concentration  was  394  ±  34  ppm\\n(SD)  while  in  the  future  climate  chambers  it  was  625  ±  53  ppm\\n(SD).  Every  half  hour,  Tair was  monitored  with  a  temperature\\nsensor  (Siemens,  type  QFA66,  Germany)  and  photosynthetically\\nactive  radiation  was  measured  with  a  quantum  sensor  (SDEC,  type\\nJYP1000,  France).  During  the  experiment  monthly  average  Tairwas\\n17.1,  16.4  and  18.4◦C  in  May,  June  and  July  2008,  respectively.\\nIn  the  current  climate  chambers  Tairwas  on  average  0.6  ±  1.6◦C\\n(SD)  lower  than  outside  and  the  future  climate  chambers  were\\n2.5  ±  1.6◦C  (SD)  warmer  than  outside.  Total  monthly  irrigation\\nequalled  61.5,  64.4  and  85.1  mm  in  May,  June  and  July,  respectively.\\nIrrigation  was  calculated  from  the  monthly  rainfall  over  the  period\\n1995–2005  and  corrected  for  differences  in  evapotranspiration\\n(ET)  inside  and  outside  the  chambers.  To  this  end,  De  Boeck  et  al.\\n(2006)  calculated  ET  inside  current  climate  chambers  from  changes\\nin  soil  water  content  (SWC)  and  the  amount  of  administered  water,\\nand  the  outside  ET  with  Hamon’s  equation  (Haith  and  Shoemaker,\\n1987 )  based  on  day  length,  vapour  pressure  and  Tair.\\n2.2.  Plant  communities\\nThis  study  was  part  of  a  larger  experiment  that  consisted  of  30\\nrandomly  placed  grassland  communities  per  chamber.  Each  com-\\nmunity  was  composed  of  six  species,  selected  from  three  functional\\ngroups  which  were  equally  represented:  two  grass  species  (Poa\\npratensis  L.  and  Lolium  perenne  L.),  two  N-ﬁxing  dicots  (Medicago\\nlupulina  L.  and  Lotus  corniculatus  L.),  and  two  non-N-ﬁxing  dicots\\n(Rumex  acetosa  L.  and  Plantago  lanceolata  L.).  The  communities  con-\\ntained  18  individuals  (three  per  species)  planted  in  a  hexagonal\\ngrid  with  a  4.5  cm  interspace,  with  interspeciﬁc  interactions  maxi-\\nmized  by  avoiding  clumping.  Communities  were  established  early\\nMay  2008  (day  of  year  (DOY)  134–137)  by  transplanting  5-week-\\nold seedlings  to  PVC  containers  (tubes,  24  cm  inner  diameter  and\\n40  cm  height,  closed  with  a  lid  at  the  bottom)  ﬁlled  with  sandy  soil152  K.  Naudts  et  al.  /  Environmental  and  Experimental  Botany  99  (2014)  150–158\\n(93.2%  sand,  4.6%  silt,  2.2%  clay;  pH  7.6;  1.0%  total  C,  total  Kjeldahl-\\nN  0.42  g  kg−1;  CEC  3.9  meq  100  g−1fresh  weight;  ﬁeld  capacity\\n0.13  m3m−3;  wilting  point  0.069  m3m−3;  background  Zn  concen-\\ntration  21.4  mg  kg−1dry  soil).  The  containers  were  buried  in  the  soil\\nto  avoid  unnatural  soil  temperatures.\\n2.3.  Imposed  stressors\\nFor  the  present  study,  a  subset  of  8  communities  per  chamber\\nwas  used.  In  each  chamber  one  community  was  given  no  stress  (U:\\n“unstressed”)  and  seven  communities  were  subjected  to  drought\\nstress  (D),  nitrogen  limitation  (N),  zinc  toxicity  (Z)  or  a  combination\\nof  these  stressors  (DN,  DZ,  NZ  or  DNZ).  Drought  stress  was  applied\\nby  withholding  water  for  a  period  of  14  days  in  the  ﬁrst  half  of  July\\n2008  (DOY  182–196).  Soil  water  content  was  measured  with  a  PR2\\nsoil  moisture  sensor  (Delta-T  Devices  Ltd.,  UK)  two  times  a  week\\nduring  the  drought  treatment  and  once  a  week  throughout  the  rest\\nof the  experiment.\\nThe  communities  were  fertilized  with  15  g  N  m−2NH 4NO 3,\\n7.5  g  m−2P2O5,  15  g  m−2K2O  and  micro-elements  (Fe,  Mn,  Zn,  Cu,  B,\\nMo),  with  the  exception  of  the  communities  that  were  subjected  to\\nN  limitation.  These  received  all  nutrients  in  the  same  dose  except\\nfor  nitrogen.  All  nutrients  were  given  dissolved  in  water,  half  on\\nDOY  146  and  the  other  half  on  DOY  171.  Nitrogen  concentrations\\nwere  measured  with  a  CN  element  analyser  (NC-2100,  Carlo  Erba\\nInstruments,  Milan,  Italy)  after  grinding  the  samples.  Total  com-\\nmunity  N  stock  (above-ground  +  roots)  was  determined  on  each\\ncommunity  by  multiplying  N  concentrations  with  biomass,  sep-\\narately  for  the  above-ground  and  the  root  compartment.\\nZinc  was  mixed  with  the  soil  40  days  before  the  seedlings  were\\ntransplanted  to  the  containers,  so  that  the  soil  could  stabilize.  Per\\ncontainer  280  ml  of  a  50  g  Zn  L−1ZnCl 2solution  was  administered.\\nConcentrations  of  Zn  in  roots  and  shoots  were  measured  after  diges-\\ntion  by  warming  with  HNO 3and  H2O2,  using  mass  spectrometry\\n(ICP-MS,  Finnigan  Element  XR,  Scientiﬁc,  Bremen,  Germany).\\n2.4. Biomass  harvest\\nAbove-ground  (shoot  –  above  3.5  cm  –  and  stubble)  and  root\\nbiomass  were  harvested  immediately  after  the  imposed  drought\\nperiod (DOY  196–200).  Above-ground  biomass  was  subdivided\\nby  species.  In  each  chamber  one  community  was  harvested  per\\ntreatment,  yielding  three  replicates  (chambers)  per  climate.  Per\\nspecies  a  subsample  was  taken  from  the  shoot  biomass  and  its  fresh\\nweight  was  determined.  The  remaining  shoot  was  weighed  fresh\\nand  immediately  frozen  in  liquid  nitrogen  (see  further).  The  total\\nshoot  dry  weight  per  species  was  calculated  from  the  total  shoot\\nfresh  weight  and  the  dry  weight/fresh  weight  ratio  of  the  subsam-\\nple.  Dry  weights  were  determined  after  drying  the  biomass  for  48  h\\nat  70◦C.  The  shoot  dry  weight  of  the  community  was  calculated\\nas  the  sum  of  the  shoot  dry  weights  of  the  six  composing  species.\\nRoot  biomass  was  estimated  from  12  soil  cores  (2  cm  diameter)  per\\ncommunity.  To  adequately  represent  the  total  root  biomass  in  the\\nsoil,  six  cores  were  taken  directly  below  the  plants  (one  per  species)\\nand  six  cores  in  the  middle  of  a  triangle  between  three  plant  pos-\\nitions.  Root  samples  were  washed  until  they  were  free  of  soil.  Total\\nbiomass  included  the  sum  of  above-ground  and  root  biomass.\\n2.5. Biochemical parameters\\nTo  detect  the  underlying  metabolic  processes  that  determine\\nthe  effect  of  climate  on  the  stress  response  of  the  communities,\\nwe  analyzed  several  biochemical  parameters:  insoluble  sugar  (IS)\\nconcentrations, lipid  peroxidation,  total  antioxidant  capacity  (TAC),polyphenol  concentrations,  tocopherol  concentrations  and,  ascor-\\nbate  (ASC)  and  glutathione  (GSH)  concentrations  and  redox  status.\\n2.5.1. Insoluble  sugar  concentration\\nInsoluble sugar  (IS)  concentrations  were  determined  according\\nto  Leyva  et  al.  (2008) .  Fifty  mg  frozen  shoot  tissue  was  homogenized\\nin 2  ml  of  pure  acetone  to  extract  and  remove  interfering  pigments\\nand  soluble  sugars,  centrifuged  at  9.5  g  for  20  min,  and  the  super-\\nnatant  decanted.  Insoluble  sugars  were  extracted  by  adding  1.1%\\nHCl  to  the  residues,  heating  for  30  min  at  100◦C,  cooling  and  cen-\\ntrifugation  (9.5  g,  20  min).  The  supernatant  was  diluted  with  water\\nto  5  ml.  Freshly  prepared  anthrone  reagent  (150  /H9262l)  was  combined\\nwith  50  /H9262l  of  the  sample  dilutions  in  a  microplate,  and  absorbance\\nwas  measured  at  620  nm  (Multiskan  RC  plate  reader  type  351,  Lab-\\nsystems,  Colorado,  USA).  Glucose  was  used  for  the  standard  curve.\\n2.5.2. Lipid  peroxidation\\nLipid peroxidation  was  determined  using  the  thiobarbituric\\nacid–malondialdehyde  (TBA–MDA)  assay  (Hodges  et  al.,  1999 ).  Five\\nhundred  microliter  of  plant  shoot  extract  (see  above)  was  combined\\nwith  500  /H9262l  of  MDA  reagent  [20%  (w/v)  trichloroacetic  acid,  0.01%\\n(w/v)  butylated  hydroxytoluene],  with  or  without  0.65%  (w/v)  TBA.\\nThe  samples  were  mixed,  incubated  at  95◦C  for  30  min,  cooled\\nand  re-centrifuged.  Absorbance  was  measured  (Milton  Roy  Spec-\\ntronic  301,  New  York,  USA)  at  440  nm,  532  nm  and  600  nm.  MDA\\nequivalents  were  calculated  as  described  by  Hodges  et  al.  (1999) .\\n2.5.3. Total  antioxidant  capacity\\nA modiﬁed ferric  ion  reducing  antioxidant  power  (FRAP)  assay\\nwas  used  to  estimate  the  total  antioxidant  capacity  (TAC)  of\\nplant  extracts  (Benzie  and  Strain,  1996 ).  Two  hundred  mg  of\\nfrozen  shoot  tissue  was  extracted  in  2  ml  of  80%  (v/v)  ethanol\\nusing  by  mortar  and  pestle,  followed  by  centrifugation  (3000  ×  g\\nfor  15  min,  4◦C).  The  samples  were  then  mixed  with  the  FRAP\\nreagent,  and  the  absorption  was  measured  at  600  nm  after  3  and\\n20  min  (Multiskan  RC  plate  reader  type  351).  6-Hydroxy-2,5,7,8-\\ntetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic  acid  (Trolox)  was  used  as  the\\nstandard.\\n2.5.4.  Polyphenol  concentration\\nThe concentration  of  polyphenols  in  the  80%  (v/v)  ethanol\\nplant  extracts  was  determined  spectrophotometrically  using  the\\nFolin–Ciocalteu reagent,  following  the  method  of  Galvez  et  al.\\n(2005) .  Brieﬂy,  100  /H9262l  of  extract  were  diluted  with  2  ml  water,\\n200  /H9262l  Folin–Ciocalteu  phenol  reagent,  and  1  ml  of  15%  (w/v)\\nNa 2CO 3,  mixed  and  allowed  to  stand  for  2  h.  The  absorbance  was\\nmeasured  at  765  nm  (Milton  Roy  Spectronic  301).

The  purity  and  identity  of  the  peaks\\nwere  conﬁrmed  using  a  diode  array  detector  (SPD-M10AVP,  Shi-\\nmadzu),  in  line  with  the  electrochemical  detector.

The  redox  statuses  were  determined  by  dividing  the\\nreduced  form  of  the  antioxidant  by  the  total  concentration.  In  the\\nN-ﬁxing  species  (M.  lupulina ,  L.  corniculatus ),  GSH  is  largely  replaced\\nby  hGSH,  and  we  used  the  added  concentrations  (hGSH  +  GSH).\\n2.6. Calculations  and  statistical  analysis\\nAll data  are  analyzed  at  community  level  rather  than  at  species\\nlevel  since  analyses  of  the  species  responses  would  ignore  the  rel-\\native  share  of  each  species  in  the  community.  Furthermore,  this\\napproach  is  more  relevant  when  predicting  agricultural  produc-\\ntivity  losses  or  stress  impacts  on  the  C  cycle.  To  determine  the\\ncontribution  of  each  species  to  the  overall  community  for  the  bio-\\nchemical  parameters,  individual  species  values  were  multiplied\\nwith  the  corresponding  dry  weight  biomass  proportion  of  the\\nspecies  in  the  community.  Biochemical  parameters  are  expressed\\non  a  fresh  weight  basis.\\nTo  allow  separation  of  a  climate  effect  on  the  response  to  stress\\nfrom  a  climate  effect  on  the  unstressed  communities,  we  calculated\\nthe stress  responses  (impact)  for  each  climate.  We  therefore  sub-\\ntracted  the  values  of  the  unstressed  communities  from  the  values\\nof  the  stressed  communities  of  the  corresponding  climate  (further\\nreferred  to  as  ‘stress  impact’).  The  analysis  of  both  the  absolute  val-\\nues  of  the  stressed  communities  and  the  stress  impact,  indirectly\\ngave  us  information  on  the  climate  effect  in  unstressed  communi-\\nties.  For  example,  if  there  was  a  signiﬁcant  effect  of  climate  on  the\\nabsolute  values  of  the  stressed  communities,  and  no  effect  on  stress\\nimpact,  we  concluded  that  the  observed  climate  effect  was  present\\nin  the  unstressed  communities  as  well,  as  they  served  as  the  refer-\\nence  to  calculate  the  stress  impact.  To  visualize  the  stress  impact\\nresults,  the  stress  impact  in  future  climate  was  plotted  against  the\\nstress  impact  in  current  climate  for  all  different  parameters  (see  for\\nexample  Fig.  1a).  The  1:1  line  in  these  graphs  represents  a  stress\\nimpact  that  is  not  altered  by  climate;  values  above  the  1:1  line  rep-\\nresent  an  increased  positive  or  a  reduced  negative  impact  of  stress\\nin  future  climate;  values  below  the  1:1  line  represent  a  reduced\\npositive  or  an  increased  negative  impact  of  stress  in  future  climate.\\nHence,  per  parameter  two  statistical  analyses  were  performed:\\none  on  the  absolute  values  of  the  parameter  in  the  stressed  com-\\nmunities  and  a  second  on  the  stress  impact  values.  ANOVA’s  were\\nperformed  in  SAS  9.1  (SAS  Institute  Inc.,  Cary,  NC,  USA)  using  the\\nmixed  procedure  (Littell  et  al.,  1996 )  with  climate  and  stress  (=  all\\nstressors  and  their  combinations)  as  ﬁxed  factors,  and  chamber  as  a\\nrandom  factor  nested  within  climate.  Effects  were  considered  sig-\\nniﬁcant at  P  <  0.05.  Non-signiﬁcant  terms  were  excluded  from  the\\nmodel.  We  did  not  perform  a  multifactorial  analysis  with  the  threestressors  as  ﬁxed  factors  because  the  scope  of  this  paper  is  to  study\\nthe  effect  of  climate  on  stress  impact  rather  than  the  interactions\\nbetween  stressors.  Combining  the  stressors  and  their  combinations\\nin  one  ﬁxed  factor  increased  the  statistical  power  to  detect  an  effect\\nof  climate  on  the  stress  impact.\\n3.  Results\\n3.1.  Intensity  of  the  stressors\\nApplication  of  stressors  effectively  deteriorated  growth  condi-\\ntions  for  the  plant  communities.  Nitrogen  limited  communities  (N,\\nNZ,  DN,  DNZ)  had  a  lower  total  N  stock  than  unstressed  communi-\\nties  (F4,22 =  12.58,  P  <  0.001;  a  posteriori  comparison  of  unstressed\\nwith  stressed  communities,  P  <  0.05  in  all  cases;  Figure  S1).  Zn  con-\\ncentrations  were  higher  in  communities  with  added  Zn  (Z,  NZ,  DZ,\\nDNZ)  than  in  unstressed  communities,  for  shoots  as  well  as  for\\nroots  (F4,24 =  5.61,  P  =  0.025  and  F4,24 =  14.09,  P  <  0.001,  a  posteriori\\ncomparison  of  unstressed  with  stressed  communities,  P  <  0.05  in  all\\ncases;  Figure  S2).  Logically,  SWC  decreased  in  the  drought  stressed\\ncommunities  (D,  DN,  DZ,  DNZ)  after  withholding  water  (DOY  182,\\nFigure  S3).\\nThe  N  stock  of  the  communities  did  not  differ  among  the\\nclimates  for  the  unstressed  nor  for  the  N  limited  communities\\n(F1,4=  0.01,  P  =  0.941  and  F1,17 =  3.41,  P  =  0.082,  respectively;  Fig-\\nure  S1).  Likewise,  the  shoot  and  root  Zn  concentrations  did  not\\ndiffer  among  the  climates  in  both  the  unstressed  and  the  Zn-\\npolluted  communities  (shoots:  F1,4=  0.01,  P  =  0.948  and  F1,22 =  0.02,\\nP  =  0.895;  roots:  F1,4=  0.13,  P  =  0.735  and  F1,22 =  1.14,  P  =  0.297,\\nrespectively;  Figure  S2).  In  contrast,  SWC  in  both  the  unstressed\\nand  stressed  communities  did  differ  among  the  climates  (F1,4=  7.88,\\nP  =  0.048  and  F1,4=  34.26,  P  =  0.0043,  respectively;  Figure  S3).  On\\naverage  drought  stressed  communities  (D,  DN,  DZ,  DNZ)  reached\\nwilting  point  at  DOY  189  and  186  in  current  and  future  climate,\\nrespectively  (Figure  S3).\\n3.2.  Plant  community  biomass\\nThe  above-ground  biomass  of  the  stressed  communities  was\\nconsistently  higher  in  the  future  than  in  the  current  climate,  inde-\\npendent  of  the  stress  treatment  (Fig.  1a,  Table  1).  The  stress  impact\\nplot for  above-ground  biomass  (Fig.  1b)  shows  all  observations\\nabove  the  1:1  line  and  in  the  lower  left  quadrant  (negative  val-\\nues),  demonstrating  a  smaller  stress-induced  decrease  of  biomass\\nproduction  in  the  future  climate  (Table  1).  This  observation  indi-\\ncates  a  mitigated  impact  of  a  variety  of  stressors  on  above-ground\\nbiomass  in  the  future  relative  to  the  current  climate.  In  contrast  to\\nabove-ground  biomass,  roots  responded  differently  to  climate  and\\nstress  (Figure  S4  and  Section  S5).  To  help  unravel  the  molecular\\nbasis  for  the  mitigated  stress  impact  on  above-ground  biomass  in\\nfuture  climate,  we  investigated  changes  in  the  sugar  content  and  in\\nplant  oxidative  stress  responses.\\n3.3. Insoluble sugar  concentration  and  lipid  peroxidation\\nThe insoluble sugar  concentration  reﬂects  the  levels  of  struc-\\ntural  carbohydrates  and  starch,  and  is  an  indicator  of  sugar  storage\\nand  cell  wall  formation  activities.  The  IS  levels  of  the  stressed  com-\\nmunities  did  not  differ  among  the  climates  (Fig.  2a,  Table  1).  The\\nstress  impact  on  IS,  on  the  other  hand,  was  smaller  in  future  (near\\nzero)  than  in  current  climate  conditions  (positive  values)  (Fig.  2b;\\nbelow  1:1  line,  Table  1).  Hence,  relative  to  unstressed  plants,  plants\\nunder  stress  allocated  less  C  towards  IS  in  the  future  than  in  the\\ncurrent  climate.\\nMalondialdehyde (MDA)  levels  are  commonly  used  as  an  indi-\\ncator  of  ROS-induced  membrane  damage.

Hence,  stress-induced\\ndamage  to  cell  membranes  was  probably  limited,  and  did  not  differ\\namong  the  climates,  neither  in  unstressed  nor  in  stressed  commu-\\nnities.\\n3.4.  Changes  in  antioxidant  metabolism\\nOne of the  most  common  defence  responses  of  plants  against\\noxidative  stress  involves  changes  in  ROS  scavenging  antioxidant\\nmetabolites.  The  overall  TAC  was  higher  in  the  future  than  in\\nthe  current  climate  for  stressed  communities,  whereas  the  stress\\nimpact  was  not  affected  by  climate  (Fig.  2e  and  f;  scattered  around\\nthe  1:1  line,  Table  1).  From  this  we  conclude  that  the  future  climate\\nled  to  an  up-regulation  of  small  molecular  weight  antioxidants,\\nwhich  contributes  to  the  TAC  in  both  unstressed  and  stressed  con-\\nditions.\\nThe TAC  of  plant  tissues  is  determined  by  a  large  variety  of\\nantioxidant  molecules,  including  polyphenols,  tocopherols,  ASC\\nand  GSH.  We  measured  changes  in  the  levels  of  each  of  these\\ngroups  of  metabolites.  The  polyphenol  levels  followed  the  same\\npattern as  for  the  TAC;  i.e.  in  the  future  climate  an  up-regulation\\nin  both  stressed  and  unstressed  conditions  was  observed  (Table  1,Fig. 2g  and  h).  The  ﬁnding  that  polyphenol  levels  correlated  with\\nthe  TAC  suggests  that  the  TAC,  for  the  largest  part,  was  deter-\\nmined  by  polyphenolic  constituents.  The  levels  of  /H9251-tocopherol,\\na  membrane-embedded  lipophilic  antioxidant,  were  not  altered  by\\nclimate  neither  for  the  absolute  nor  for  the  stress  impact  values\\n(Table  1,  Figure  S6a  and  b).  This  result  is  consistent  with  the  lipid\\nperoxidation  data,  supporting  the  idea  of  limited  cell  membrane\\ndamage  and,  consequently,  minimal  changes  in  the  biosynthesis  of\\nlipophilic-antioxidant  compounds.\\nAscorbate  and  glutathione  are  two  essential  plant  molecu-\\nlar  antioxidants  interconnected  in  the  so-called  ASC-GSH  cycle\\n(Mittler  et  al.,  2004 ).  Both  the  absolute  levels  and  the  redox  status  of\\nthese molecules  are  considered  important  oxidative  stress  param-\\neters.  Absolute  ASC  levels  and  ASC  redox  status  of  the  stressed\\ncommunities  did  not  differ  between  the  climates.  Stress  impact  val-\\nues,  on  the  other  hand,  were  ‘zero  to  negative’  in  the  future  climate\\ncompared  to  positive  in  the  current  climate,  for  both  parameters\\n(Fig.  2i  and  j  (ASC)  and  Figure  S6c  and  d  (redox  status);  below  the\\n1:1  line,  Table  1).  This  indicates  that  in  the  future  climate  there\\nwas  an  up-regulation  of  ASC  and  an  increase  of  the  ASC  redox  sta-\\ntus  in  unstressed  communities,  which  was  no  longer  detectable\\nunder stress  conditions.  This  result  is  explained  by  an  increase  of\\nASC  and  ASC  redox  status  under  stress  in  the  current  climate,  and  aK.

However,  the  GSH  redox  status  was  not  affected  by  climate\\nneither  in  absolute  nor  in  stress  impact  values  (Figure  S6e  and  f;\\nscattered  around  the  1:1  line,  Table  1).  This  indicated  that  there\\nwere  no  stress-induced  changes  in  the  GSH  redox  status  in  plants\\ngrown  under  either  climate  conditions.\\n4.  Discussion\\nThe  present  study  unambiguously  demonstrates  that,  across\\nthree  different  abiotic  stressors,  above-ground  biomass  production\\nof  grassland  communities  was  reduced  less  by  stress  in  a  future  than\\nin  a  current  climate.  Despite  some  recent  efforts  (Aranjuelo  et  al.,\\n2006;  Bloor  et  al.,  2010;  Kongstad  et  al.,  2012 ),  very  few  studies\\nhave  focused  on  the  interactions  between  stress  impact  and  climate\\nchange.  For  N  limitation,  similar  results  were  found  in  an  earlier\\nmanipulation  experiment  on  identical  grassland  communities  in\\nwhich  N  limitation  decreased  biomass  production  under  a  current\\nclimate,  but  not  under  a  future  climate  (Van  den  Berge  et  al.,  2011b ).\\nHowever,  in  the  same  experimental  set-up  drought  impact  was  not\\naltered  by  a  future  climate  (Naudts  et  al.,  2011,  2013 ).  A  similarobservation  has  been  reported  for  Lotus  corniculatus  L.  monocul-\\ntures grown under  laboratory  conditions  at  a  constant  temperature\\n(Carter  et  al.,  1997 ).\\nWhat  mechanisms  could  be  responsible  for  the  decreased\\nimpact  of  stress  on  above-ground  productivity  under  future  climate\\nconditions?  We  have  examined  three  possible  explanations.  Firstly,\\na  future  climate  could  affect  drought  intensity  or  the  availability  of\\nN  and  Zn.  Secondly,  a  future  climate  could  alter  the  uptake  of  N,\\nZn  and  water  by  stimulating  root  production  and  thirdly,  a  future\\nclimate  could  affect  the  ability  of  plants  to  cope  with  stress  through\\nchanges  in  plant  metabolism.\\nThe  ﬁrst  mechanism  affects  exposure  to  stress  through  changes\\nin  the  availability  of  N,  Zn  or  water.  Plant  Zn  concentrations  were\\nnot  altered  by  climate.  Zinc  concentrations  found  in  plant  mate-\\nrial  are  a  good  indicator  for  metal  bioavailability  in  the  soil;  hence\\nit  is  safe  to  assume  that  Zn  availability  did  not  differ  between  cli-\\nmates  in  our  study  (Maiz  et  al.,  2000;  Van  den  Berge  et  al.,  2011a ).\\nIf  water  could  explain  the  smaller  stress  impact  on  above-ground\\nbiomass  in  the  future  climate  in  drought  stressed  communities,  we\\nwould  expect  higher  water  availability  than  in  the  current  climate.\\nThis  was  not  the  case;  we  found  that  SWC  was  lower  in  the  future\\nclimate  throughout  the  entire  experiment.  The  plant  N  stock  in\\nour  study  did  not  differ  between  climates,  suggesting  no  change156  K.  Naudts  et  al.  /  Environmental  and  Experimental  Botany  99  (2014)  150–158\\nin  N  availability  in  a  future  climate.  However,  the  fact  that  the  P-\\nvalue  of  the  interaction  between  climate  and  stress  in  the  N  limited\\ncommunities  was  close  to  0.05  (0.082)  (see  Section  3.1)  suggests\\nthat  we  cannot  completely  rule  out  changes  in  N  availability  as  an\\nexplanation  for  the  altered  biomass  response  to  stress.  Moreover,\\nan  earlier  study  by  Van  den  Berge  et  al.  (2011b)  revealed  a  mod-\\niﬁed  relation  between  added  N  and  plant  available  N  in  a  future\\nclimate,  potentially  contributing  to  an  altered  biomass  response  to\\nN  limitation.\\nThe  second  potential  mechanism  also  operates  via  changes  in\\nexposure  to  stress  and  hinges  on  altered  root  production.  Stim-\\nulated  root  production  in  a  future  climate  could  change  N,  Zn\\nand  water  uptake.  This  would  moderate  effects  of  N  limitation\\nand  drought,  but  could  intensify  Zn  toxicity.  In  previous  studies,\\nan  increased  root/shoot  ratio  under  elevated  CO 2concentrations\\nincreased  drought  tolerance  by  improving  water  and  nutrient\\nexploration  (Rogers  et  al.,  1994;  Erice  et  al.,  2006 ).  In  the  present\\nstudy,  a future climate  did  indeed  enhance  root  production  in\\nunstressed  communities,  but  this  stimulation  was  lost  under  stress.\\nHence, an altered  uptake  of  N,  Zn  or  water  due  to  an  altered  root  pro-\\nduction  is  unlikely  to  explain  the  above-ground  biomass  response.\\nDifferences in exposure  to  stress  due  to  altered  availability  or\\nuptake  of  Zn  and  water  were  thus  unlikely  to  explain  the  altered\\nbiomass response under  future  climate  conditions.  In  the  speciﬁc\\ncase  of  N  limitation,  an  altered  availability  could  not  be  excluded.\\nHowever,  this  does  not  eliminate  the  possibility  of  a  simultaneous\\nincrease  in  protection  through  changes  in  plant  metabolism,  which\\nis  the  third  mechanism  we  explored.  Therefore,  we  analyzed  C\\nallocation  to  starch  and  cell  wall  material  (IS),  as  well  as  plant\\nantioxidant  responses.\\nThe  positive  stress  impact  values  of  IS  in  a  current  climate\\nindicate  that  plants  responded  to  stress  by  incorporating  more\\nC  into  structural  carbohydrates.  In  contrast,  plants  in  the  future\\nclimate  did  not  exhibit  such  increased  C  allocation  to  storage\\nor  structural  elements  (stress  impact  values  around  0)  upon\\nstress.  Converting  sugars  to  storage  and  structural  materials  may\\nat  ﬁrst  seem  a  beneﬁcial  response  upon  stress  exposure,  but\\nretaining  higher  amounts  of  soluble  sugars  could  enhance  stress\\nprotection.  Soluble  sugars  have  been  found  to  assist  in  osmotic\\nadjustments (Tarczynski  et  al.,  1993 ),  membrane  and  protein  sta-\\nbilization  (Amiard  et  al.,  2003;  Hincha  et  al.,  2003 ),  and  can  have\\na  signalling  function  in  regulating  stress  and  defence  responses\\n(Gomez-Ariza  et  al.,  2007 ).  Moreover,  an  increasing  number  of  stud-\\nies  indicate  that  sugar  and  sugar-like  compounds  can  act  as  ROS\\nscavengers,  working  in  concert  with  vacuolar  phenolic  compounds\\nand  the  ‘classic’  cytosolic  antioxidant  mechanisms  (Nishizawa  et  al.,\\n2008;  Peshev  et  al.,  2013 ).  Our  results  suggest  that  future  climate\\nconditions  affect  the  stress-induced  changes  in  sugar  metabolism,\\nwhich  could  potentially  explain  an  enhanced  protective  capacity.\\nFurther  analysis  of  metabolite  levels  and  sugar  dynamics  is  neces-\\nsary  to  understand  these  metabolic  changes  and  to  elucidate  the\\nimportance  of  this  response  in  stress  protection  under  future  cli-\\nmate  conditions.\\nIncreased  levels  of  enzymatic  and  molecular  antioxidants  are\\noften  associated  to  stress  tolerance  (Mittler,  2002;  Le  Martret\\net  al.,  2011 ).  A  key  explanation  for  the  reduced  stress  impact  on\\nplant  biomass  production  that  we  observed,  was  therefore  found\\nin  the  increased  levels  of  several  small  molecular  antioxidants  in\\nthe  future  climate-grown  plants.  Increases  in  TAC  and  polyphe-\\nnol  levels  were  observed  for  unstressed  and  stressed  communities,\\nindicating  that  future  climate  improves  the  protective  capacity  of\\nplant  communities.  Higher  antioxidant  levels  probably  protected\\nplant  metabolism  against  oxidative  stress  impact  and  contributed\\nto  the  smaller  reduction  in  above-ground  biomass  in  the  future\\nclimate treatment.  The  improved  protective  capacity  could  be\\nexplained  by  an  increased  capacity  for  detoxiﬁcation  and  repairthrough  an  increased  internal  availability  of  C  under  elevated  CO 2\\n(Carlson  and  Bazzaz,  1982 ).\\nIncreases  in  other  antioxidants,  ASC  and  GSH,  and  in  the  ASC\\nredox  status  were  only  apparent  in  the  unstressed  communities.\\nThe  stress  impact  values  for  ASC  and  GSH  levels  and  ASC  redox\\nstatus  were  positive  in  the  current  climate,  but  zero  to  negative  in\\nthe  future  climate.  These  results  are  consistent  with  the  idea  that\\nthese  antioxidants  were  ‘more  effectively  consumed’  by  the  plants\\ngrown  in  a  future  climate,  supporting  their  role  in  protection  and\\ncontinued  growth.  The  difference  in  response  to  stress  conditions\\nfor  ASC,  GSH  (not  increased)  and  TAC  (increased),  is  not  a  surprise,\\nas  ASC  and  GSH  represent  only  a  fraction  of  the  TAC,  and  therefore\\nnot  necessarily  show  the  same  pattern.\\nComprehensive  analyses  of  plant  stress  responses,  at  various\\nlevels  of  organization,  under  different  climate  conditions,  provide\\ncrucial  information  to  predict  future  ecosystem  functioning.  Since\\nit  is  unfeasible  to  test  all  possible  stressors  in  a  realistic  exper-\\nimental  set-up, a mechanistic  understanding  of  stress  responses\\nin  a  future  climate  is  highly  important.  Reports  on  multiple  stress\\nresponses under combined  elevated  CO 2and  warming,  containing\\nbiochemical  as  well  as  ecological  response  variables  are  very  rare.\\nAlso, studies on  the  single  effects  of  elevated  CO 2on  antioxidant\\nmetabolism  remain  inconclusive  (Tausz  et  al.,  2007 ).  A  reduction  in\\nROS formation under  elevated  CO 2can  lead  to  a  down-regulation\\nof  the  protective  systems  in  plants  (Schwanz  and  Polle,  1998;  Vurro\\net  al.,  2009;  Gillespie  et  al.,  2011 ),  but  other  studies  have  found  an\\nenhanced  protective  capacity  (Schwanz  and  Polle,  2001;  Geissler\\net  al.,  2010 )  or  even  an  increase  in  oxidative  stress  (Qiu  et  al.,  2008 ).\\nOne  other  experiment  tackling  the  effect  of  climate  on  drought\\nstress,  did  not  show  an  increased  protective  effect  of  future  cli-\\nmate  at  the  antioxidant  level,  which  was  in  line  with  the  absence\\nof  an  effect  of  future  climate  at  the  biomass  level  (Farfan-Vignolo\\nand  Asard,  2012 ).  This  discrepancy  with  our  ﬁndings  indicates  that\\nthe  protective  effect  of  future  climate  –  at  the  biochemical  and\\ntherefore  also  at  the  biomass  level  –  is  highly  dependent  on  the\\ntiming,  intensity  and  duration  of  the  stressor.  In  a  study  on  the  com-\\nbined  effects  of  elevated  CO 2,  warming  and  drought  on  regrowth\\nof  Medicago  sativa  L.  30  days  after  cutting,  a  smaller  reduction\\nin  regrowth  was  found  in  future  than  in  current  climate  (Erice\\net al.,  2007 ).  With  regard  to  concentrations  of  antioxidant  metabo-\\nlites  (ASC  and  GSH)  there  was  no  effect  of  climate  in  unstressed\\ncommunities,  while  in  stressed  communities  the  future  climate\\ncaused  an  up-regulation  of  GSH  (Erice  et  al.,  2007 ).  In  our  study\\nwe  found  an  up-regulation  in  both  the  ASC  and  GSH  levels  in  a\\nfuture  climate  in  unstressed,  but  not  in  stressed  communities.  We\\nhypothesize  that  the  up-regulation  of  antioxidants  in  a  future  cli-\\nmate  is  explained  by  an  increased  availability  of  substrates  for  their\\nsynthesis.  However,  the  mechanistic  understanding  of  the  effect  of\\na  future  climate  on  antioxidant  metabolism  should  be  the  subject  of\\nfurther  research.  We  therefore  suggest  a  more  extensive  study  that\\nincludes  the  determination  of  additional  biochemical  parameters\\nrelated  to  plant  defence  mechanisms  including  proline  biosynthe-\\nsis,  sugar  dynamics,  changes  in  osmolyte  levels,  and  the  analysis  of\\nplant  antioxidant  enzymes.\\nIn  conclusion,  we  can  conﬁrm  the  hypothesis  that  a  future\\nclimate  ameliorates  plant  protection  against  stress.  Under  stress,\\nplants  grown  in  a  future  climate  had  a  smaller  reduction  in  above-\\nground  biomass  production  than  plants  grown  in  current  climate.\\nOur  results  indicate  three  mutually  non-exclusive  explanations  for\\nthis  response:  (i)  TAC  and  polyphenol  levels  indicate  a  better  pro-\\ntection  against  stress,  (ii)  ASC  and  GSH  are  more  efﬁciently  used\\nas  antioxidants,  and  (iii)  changes  in  sugar  metabolism  provide  an\\nenhanced  stress  protection  in  future  climate.

It is not surprising therefore that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in\\nabundance by photosynthesis, providing a plethora of redox signals as well as functioning as essential regulatorsof energy and metabolic ﬂuxes. Chloroplasts are equipped with an elaborate and multifaceted protective net-\\nwork that allows photosynthesis to function with high productivity even in resource-limited natural environ-\\nments. This includes numerous antioxidants with overlapping functions that provide enormous ﬂexibility in\\nredox control. ROS are an integral part of the repertoire of chloroplast signals that are transferred to the nucleus\\nto convey essential information concerning redox pressure within the electron transport chain. Current evidence\\nsuggests that there is speci ﬁcity in the gene-expression pro ﬁles triggered by the di ﬀerent ROS signals, so that\\nsinglet oxygen triggers programs related to over excitation of photosystem (PS) II while superoxide and hy-\\ndrogen peroxide promote the expression of other suites of genes that may serve to alleviate electron pressure on\\nthe reducing side of PSI. Not all chloroplasts are equal in their signaling functions, with some sub-populations\\nappearing to have better contacts/access to the nucleus than others to promote genetic and epigenetic responses.While the concept that light-induced increases in ROS result in damage to PSII and photoinhibition is embeddedin the photosynthesis literature, there is little consensus concerning the extent to which such oxidative damage\\nhappens in nature. Slowly reversible decreases in photosynthetic capacity are not necessarily the result of light-\\ninduced damage to PSII reaction centers.\\n1. Introduction\\nElectron ﬂow is the basis of life on earth, whether it is driven by\\nlight in photosynthesis or through chemical redox couples in respira-\\ntion. The incorporation of photosynthesis into eukaryotic cells during\\nevolution not only provided enormous bene ﬁts in terms of energy\\nmetabolism, but also signi ﬁcantly extended the cellular capacity for\\nreduction/oxidation (redox) regulation and signaling. The incorpora-\\ntion of the photosynthetic electron transport chain appears to have been\\naccompanied by a large expansion of protein cysteine thiols used to\\nsense and regulate cellular redox state ( Woehle et al., 2017). The op-\\neration of photosynthesis also resulted in a large increase in the pro-duction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide, hydrogen\\nperoxide and singlet oxygen. The explosion of oxidative signals arising\\nfrom photosynthesis, together with the signi ﬁcant expansion of the\\nredox-sensitive proteome, not only provided cells with mechanisms tomonitor photosynthetic electron ﬂow and thus prevent over-reduction\\nor over-oxidation, but also produced redox regulatory networks thatenable plants to sense and respond to ﬂuctuating environmental con-\\nditions ( Martin and Sies, 2017). While the concept that cells need to\\nmanage ROS production and removal to avoid excessive and irrever-\\nsible oxidation is embed in the animal and plant literature, the con-\\nsensus of opinion is now shifting towards a recognition of the positive\\nroles of ROS as essential pro-life signals ( Noctor and Foyer, 2016 ;Foyer\\net al., 2017 ). Within the complex redox landscape of photosynthetic\\ncells, ROS production is essential for redox sensing, signaling and reg-\\nulation. The best characterized signaling mechanisms involve redox\\nchanges in cysteines either on low-molecular-weight thiols, particularly\\nglutathione, or on proteins thiol groups with oxidation states of the\\nsulphur moieties ranging from thiols ( –RSH) and disul ﬁdes ( –RSSR –)t o\\ntrisulﬁdes and possibly even tetrasul ﬁdes ( Noctor et al., 2011 ). In\\nphotosynthesis, this thiol-disulphide exchange system is used to co-or-\\ndinate the rates of NADP and ATP generation to the rates of their uti-\\nlization in photosynthetic carbon assimilation through the mediation of\\nthioredoxins (TRXs). This extensive network of interactive redox reg-\\nulation occurs together with other post-translational modi ﬁcations\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.05.003\\nReceived 11 April 2018; Received in revised form 3 May 2018; Accepted 3 May 2018E-mail address: c.foyer@leeds.ac.uk .Environmental and E xperimental Botany 154 (2018) 134–142\\nAvailable online 06 May 2018\\n0098-8472/ © 2018 The Author.

Exposure to oxidative stress in ﬂuences two other poorly\\ncharacterized plant PTMs, protein succinylation and acetylation ( Zhou\\net al., 2017 ). This analysis of H 2O2-triggered interactions between the\\nrice leaf lysine succinylome and acetylome revealed speci ﬁceﬀects on\\nphotosynthetic proteins, but the functional signi ﬁcance of these PTMs\\nremains to be established ( Zhou et al., 2017 ). Moreover, the chloroplast\\nthylakoid lumen also contains redo-regulated proteins. Within the\\nlumen, proteins such as the immunophilin, FKBP13, polyphenol oxidase\\nand violaxanthin de-epoxidase, are regulated by oxidative activation\\nfacilitated by the oxygen produced by PSII ( Buchanan & Luan, 2005 ).\\nLight-driven redox changes in the photosynthetic electron transport\\nsystem drive energy conversion that is harnessed in the forms of re-\\nducing power (reduced ferredoxin and NADPH) and ATP. The rate of\\ncarbon assimilation is matched to prevailing electron ﬂuxes through the\\nreduction of TRXs. Reduced TRXs then reduce disulphide bridges ontarget proteins within the Calvin cycle ( Buchanan and Balmer, 2005;\\nNikkanen and Rintamäki, 2014 ). Chloroplasts house a large number of\\ndiﬀerent TRX forms ( Meyer et al., 2012). These TRXs can be reduced by\\ntwo pathways that show some overlap with regard to their target pro-teins ( Nikkanen and Rintamäki, 2014 ;Nikkanen et al., 2017 ). The\\nferredoxin-dependent TRX system is driven by reduced ferredoxinproduced by PSI. Reduced TRX is generated through the mediation of\\nferredoxin-thioredoxin reductases. The pathway is responsible for the\\nlight-induced activation of enzymes of photosynthetic carbon assim-\\nilation ( Michelet et al., 2013 ;Geigenberger and Fernie, 2014), in-\\ncluding fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase), phosphoribulokinase (PRK) and glycer-\\naldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). In addition, this\\npathway regulates the thylakoid chloroplast ATP synthase ( Hisabori\\net al., 2013), the malate-oxaloacetate shuttle ( Scheibe and Dietz, 2012 ),\\nthe ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase step of starch synthesis(Thormählen et al., 2013 ) and the Mg-protoporphyrin methyl-\\ntransferase step in chlorophyll biosynthesis ( Richter et al., 2013). In\\naddition to the ferredoxin-dependent TRX system, there is an NADPH-\\ndependent thioredoxin reductase (NTRC) pathway, which can also ac-\\ntivate the carbon assimilation enzymes either directly or through in-\\nteraction with the ferredoxin-TRX system. The operation of the NTRC\\npathway may be crucial in activating the photosynthetic enzymes under\\nlow light intensities ( Nikkanen et al., 2017).\\nThe ferredoxin-dependent TRX and NTRC systems function together\\nwith 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins (2-Cys PRX) as a two-component hy-\\ndrogen peroxide-detoxifying system under stress conditions ( Perez-Ruiz\\net al., 2006 ;Bernal-Bayard et al., 2014 ). 2-Cys PRXs act together with\\nthe ascorbate-glutathione cycle to limit the accumulation of hydrogen\\nperoxide produced by photosynthesis ( Foyer and Shigeoka, 2011 ). It is\\nalso worthy of note that TRXz is required for the correct assembly of theplastid PEP polymerase and the developmental transition from nuclear-\\nencoded RNA polymerase-driven transcription to PEP-dependent tran-\\nscription of plastid genes, such as psbA that encodes the D1 protein of\\nPSII ( Dietz and Pfannschmidt, 2011). Moreover, TRXx, TRXy and\\nCDSP32 are important in chloroplast responses to oxidative stress(Collin et al., 2003, 2004 ;Broin et al., 2002 ). ROS accumulation within\\nchloroplasts is controlled by a complex antioxidant-scavenging system(Foyer and Shigeoka, 2011 ) that includes TRXs and 2-Cys PRXs as well\\nas\\nantioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and as-\\ncorbate peroxidase (APX), and low molecular weight antioxidants, such\\nas ascorbate ( Fig. 1A) that also play roles in transmitting oxidative\\nsignals as well as controlling ROS accumulation ( Foyer et al., 2017;\\nNoctor et al., 2017 ).\\nFor many years, the dominant concept in redox signaling has been\\nthat cells balance ROS on one side and antioxidants on the other\\n(Noctor et al., 2017 ). According to this concept, oxidative signaling\\nshifts this balance such that ROS accumulate, either through an increasein their production or a decrease in antioxidant capacity. This conceptsuggests that, when ROS are low, cell signaling entrains acclimation\\nand improved stress tolerance and that, when ROS are in excess of\\nantioxidant capacity, the resulting enhanced oxidation causes damage\\nand entrains programmed cell death. While this concept continues to be\\nuseful, recent work suggests that it needs to be updated, notably to take\\naccount of the complexity and speci ﬁcity of plant antioxidative systems\\nas well as their roles in signaling ( Fig. 1B). It has, therefore, been\\nsuggested that “ROS processing systems ”would be a more accurate\\nterm than “antioxidative systems ”to describe cellular components that\\nare most likely to interact with ROS and, in doing so, transmit oxidative\\nsignals ( Noctor et al., 2017 ). The direction of signal ﬂow will depend on\\nfactors such as the proximity of the ROS target, its relative susceptibilityto oxidation and its abundance in relation to other targets. In this way,\\noxidative signals may have a high level of speci ﬁcity in a ROS-de-\\ntermined wheel of cell fortune or fate. Within this context, redox signalsarising from the chloroplasts will readily interact with components of\\nthe phytohormone signaling network to regulate plant growth and de-\\nfense pathways in response to a changing environment ( Bartoli et al.,\\n2013 ).\\n2. ROS formation in chloroplasts\\nOxygen is an important electron acceptor in photosynthesis. The\\nreduction of molecular oxygen by PSI in the Mehler reaction is a cou-\\npled process leading to the formation of ATP without NADPH. Oxygen\\nreduction provides an alternative electron sink and generates super-\\noxide anion radicals that are converted to H\\n2O2by the action of the\\nthylakoid copper/zinc SODs. H 2O2can then be reduced to water by\\nchloroplast APXs and the PRXs ( Awad et al., 2015). In the overall\\nprocess, known as the water-water cycle, two electrons are used to\\nproduce H 2O2and two are required to metabolize H 2O2to water, al-\\nlowing the dissipation of excess excitation energy and electrons ( Foyer\\net al., 1991; Osmond and Grace, 1995 ;Asada, 2000 ). While this process\\nmay only make a minor contribution to thylakoid acidi ﬁcation and the\\ncontrol of PSII activity because it is saturated at relatively low irra-\\ndiances ( Heber, 2002; Driever and Baker, 2011 ), it is undoubtedly an\\nimportant source of oxidative signals that may be directly or indirectlybe transferred to the nucleus ( Fey et al., 2005 ;Noctor and Foyer, 2016;\\nExposito-Rodriguez et al., 2007). One possibility is that H\\n2O2generated\\nby photosynthesis may be directly transferred to the nucleus from at-\\ntached chloroplasts ( Fig. 2 ;Exposito-Rodriguez et al., 2007 ). Thus, the\\nMehler reaction might itself function as a signaling mechanism, withH\\n2O2production acting as a measure of electron transport activity\\n(Exposito-Rodriguez et al., 2007). Another mechanism of direct transfer\\nof H 2O2to the nucleus is via stromules ( Fig. 3 ;Caplan et al., 2015 ).\\nIt is now well-established that ROS are key components of chlor-\\noplast-nucleus retrograde signaling pathways, working together with a\\ncomplex array of putative retrograde signaling molecules including\\nmetabolites and mobile transcription factors, calcium and links to\\npathways such as the unfolded protein response. Of these, the 3 ′-\\nphosphoadenosine 5′ -phosphate (PAP) phosphatase called SAL1 is\\nperhaps the best characterized; SAL1 is thought to act as a sensor of\\noxidative stress in the chloroplasts because it undergoes a conforma-\\ntional change in response to redox changes. Chloroplast oxidation re-\\nsults in deactivation of SAL1 and accumulation of its substrate PAP,\\nwhich acts as plastid signal instigating chloroplast-to-nucleus retro-\\ngrade signaling pathways ( Chan et al., 2016). It should be noted that\\nredox changes in other cellular compartments may inﬂ uence the sus-\\nceptibility of photosynthesis to high-light-induced inhibition and also\\nmodulate chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling and the transcriptional re-sponses of leaves to high light ( Karpinska et al., 2017a, 2017b ). Su-\\nperoxide and H\\n2O2are relatively weak oxidants. Superoxide has re-\\nceived little attention with regard to chloroplast processes because it\\nhas no reactivity to most biological molecules and is rapidly converted\\nto H 2O2by the action of thylakoid and stromal SODs. Superoxide in-\\nteracts with nitric oxide (NO) and it is also reduced to H 2O2by ascorbicC.H. Foyer Environmental and Experimental Botany 154 (2018) 134–142\\n135acid, which is abundant in chloroplasts. In the mitochondria, super-\\noxide is able to inactivate the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme aconitase,\\nwhich is a sensitive target in the matrix, but it has not been shown to\\ncause inhibition of Calvin cycle enzymes that, in contrast, are very\\nsusceptible to oxidation and inactivation by H 2O2. Hence, plastid H 2O2\\nlevels have to be very low and in the micromolar range. It is worthy ofnote that H\\n2O2and superoxide have divergent e ﬀects on cell survival\\nand programmed cell suicide pathways in animals, where H 2O2pro-\\nmotes and superoxide inhibits cell death programs and apoptotic sig-\\nnaling ( Pervaiz and Clement, 2007 ). It may be that superoxide also\\npromotes cell survival in plants, particularly in light of observations ofspatiotemporal patterns superoxide and H\\n2O2in root meristems ( Foyeret al., 2018). The short lifetimes of superoxide and singlet oxygen makethem unlikely candidates to di ﬀuse over any distances within the cell.\\nIn contrast, H\\n2O2is more stable and is thus the most likely ROS form to\\nact as a mobile signal (Foyer and Noctor, 2016).\\nChloroplast ROS are essential signals underpinning acclimation re-\\nsponses through retrograde signaling to the nucleus, and they are also\\ncomponents of whole-plant systemic signaling pathways. The small\\nplastids of the vascular parenchyma and also bundle-sheath plastids\\nfulﬁl signaling functions that regulate mesophyll plastid development\\n(Lundquist et al., 2014 ;Petrillo et al., 2014 ). Phytochrome B-mediated\\nauxin pathways transmit signals perceived by apical leaves to increasethe speed of induction of photosynthesis in distal leaves ( Guo et al.,\\n2016 ). This pathway, which transmits information concerning high\\nlight perceived at the apex, results in stimulation of H\\n2O2production in\\nsystemic leaves that are distant from the apical leaves [?] leading toincreased cyclic electron ﬂow around PSI during photosynthetic in-\\nduction ( Guo et al., 2016 ). Moreover, altering the ascorbate/DHA ratio\\nof the apoplast/cell wall compartment by manipulating ascorbate oxi-\\ndase activities was su ﬃcient to alter the ability of photosynthesis to\\nacclimate to high light ( Karpinska et al., 2017a ). Tobacco leaves with\\nlow ascorbate oxidase activities maintained higher photosynthesis rates\\nunder high light than wild type controls or plants with high ascorbate\\noxidase activities ( Karpinska et al., 2017a ). Taken together, such ﬁnd-\\nings demonstrate that photosynthesis is not only responsive to ROSproduced directly in the chloroplasts, but also to oxidants generated in\\nother parts of the cell or via phytohormone-mediated pathways to allow\\nacclimation to local and systemic cues ( Bartoli et al., 2013).\\nIn contrast to H\\n2O2, singlet oxygen (1O2), is a powerful oxidant that\\nreacts rapidly with macromolecules in the vicinity of where it is gen-\\nerated, resulting in oxidation that is often referred to as “damage” (Apel\\nand Hirt, 2004; Watabe et al., 2007 ). Much of the oxidative inactiva-\\ntion, caused by over-excitation of the photosynthetic electron transport\\nFig. 1. A. ROS formation and metabolism in chloroplasts.

The vulnerability of PSII to oxidative damage/inactivation\\nmeans that each reaction center has to be rebuilt several times an hour,\\neven under optimal irradiances. Oxidative modi ﬁcations to the D1 and\\nD2 proteins increase reaction center turnover ( Malnoë et al., 2014). It is\\npossible that the breakdown products of D1 protein might ful ﬁl sig-\\nnaling roles, but this has not as yet been demonstrated in higher plants.The subunits of the oxygen-evolving complex are also prone to ROS-\\nmediated damage/modi ﬁcation ( Henmi et al., 2004). Any damaged/\\ninactivated subunits are removed by luminal proteases that degradedamaged/inactivated components during the repair cycle, in which\\nnewly synthesized subunits are shuttled from the stroma lamellae,\\nwhere they are inserted into the thylakoids, to the granal thylakoids.\\nSinglet oxygen can also impair de novo synthesis of D1 by targeting the\\nprotein elongation factor G (CpEF-G) ( Nishiyama et al., 2006 ). D1 is co-\\ntranslationally inserted into PSII during repair via the cpSECY trans-\\nlocase ( Nilsson and van Wijk, 2002 ). However,\\n1O2would have to\\ndiﬀuse over a considerable distance if it were to target the elongation\\nfactors, and there are many other susceptible molecules in the thylakoidsystem, particularly poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and other\\nmembrane lipids ( Przybyla et al., 2008 ). These peroxidation products\\nare generated in a singlet oxygen-dependent fashion in plants exposedto high light and other stresses ( Triantaphylidès et al., 2008). Lipid\\nperoxidation, accompanied by the generation of oxylipins, is oftentaken to be a signature of photo-oxidative damage ( Girotti, 2001;\\nMueller et al., 2006 ;Przybyla et al., 2008). Moreover, excessive lipid\\nperoxidation, leading to the apparent bursting of the chloroplast\\nmembranes, is often considered by the basis for the “accidental cell\\ndeath ”phenomena described in mutants such as ﬂuand ch1(Laloi and\\nHavaux, 2015). However, chloroplasts contain many\\n1O2scavengers,\\nincluding β-carotene ascorbate, tocopherol and glutathione that pre-\\nvent such negative outcomes. Moreover, photo-protective mechanisms\\nare deployed in order to protect the photosynthetic antenna complexes\\nfrom over-excitation, when the absorption of light intensity exceeds the\\ncapacity of photochemistry to use the absorbed energy.\\nSuperoxide and hydrogen peroxide are largely generated at PSI on\\nthe stromal side of non-appressed thylakoid membranes. Singlet oxygen\\nis generated by PSII in the grana core and also by the PSII repair process\\noccurring on non-appressed margins of the grana ( Wang et al., 2016 ).\\nAccumulating evidence suggests that hydrogen peroxide and singletoxygen function as separate redox signals that are transduced by dif-\\nferent pathways to trigger the expression of speci ﬁc suites of nuclear\\ngenes. Two distinct\\n1O2−triggered chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling\\npathways have been described to date: ﬁrstly,1O2may modify gene\\nexpression through interaction with β-carotene and the generation of\\ncarotenoid breakdown products ( β-CC), some of which are volatile\\n(Ramel et al., 2012 ); secondly, the nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteinEXECUTER (EX)1 plays an essential role together with EX2 in the\\ntransmission of1O2signals ( Apel and Hirt, 2004 ;Lee et al., 2007 ,op\\nden Camp et al., 2003; Wagner et al., 2004 ,Wang et al., 2016 ). The β-\\nCC-induced and EX1-dependent pathways have only a small number of\\ncommon1O2−responsive genes, suggesting that the two pathways are\\nseparate ( Dogra et al., 2017 ). Moreover, β-CC-mediated signaling is\\nindependent of EX1/EX2 ( Ramel et al., 2013 ;Shumbe et al., 2016 ). The\\nEX1 and EX2 proteins are required for the local and systemic signalingpathways leading to gene expression changes that underpin acclimation\\nto stress caused by high light ( Carmody et al., 2016 ). The EX1 proteins\\nare mostly localized in the non-appressed margins of the grana, sug-gesting that EX1 transmits signals from\\n1O2produced in the grana\\nmargins ( Wang et al., 2016 ), where the repair of damaged/inactivated\\nPSII reaction centers (RCII) takes place through disassembly and de-\\ngradation of damaged/inactivated proteins by the membrane-bound\\nFtsH protease. EX1 is associated with RCII proteins, including D1 and\\nD2, and FtsH2 proteases, as well as with protein-elongation factors and\\nchlorophyll biosynthetic enzymes ( Wang et al., 2016). In contrast, β-\\ncarotene is likely to be more important in quenching1O2produced in\\nthe grana core ( Ramel et al., 2012, 2013 ).\\nPerception of1O2signals induces cell suicide programs in seedlings\\nand leads to growth inhibition in mature plants ( Wagner et al., 2004).\\nPhytohormones such as salicylic acid and jasmonate act as important\\npromoters or inhibitors of cell death in the ﬂuorescent (ﬂu) and chlorina\\n1(ch1) mutants, acting as key players in the decision between accli-\\nmation and cell death as they do in H 2O2–mediated induction of pro-\\ngrammed cell death observed in catalase (cat)2 mutants ( Mhamdi et al.,\\n2010, 2012 ). The FLU protein acts as a negative feedback regulator in\\nthe Mg-branch of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway in the dark. Theﬂumutants accumulate the chloroplast precursor protochlorophyllide\\n(Pchlide) in the dark because conversion of Pchlide to Chlorophyllide islight-dependent. Pchlide molecules are potent photosensitizers that\\ngenerate\\n1O2in abundance upon illumination ( Meskauskiene et al.,\\n2001 ).\\n3. Photodamage and photo-protection\\nPhotosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy through\\nan interacting series of biophysical and biochemical reactions that\\nprovide the essential driving force for reductive metabolism in plants.\\nThe dynamic regulation of the photosynthetic machinery allows con-tinuous adjustments to changes in the availability of light and carbon\\ndioxide. Plants cannot easily turn o ﬀphotosystem chemistry and this\\nﬂexibility is thus crucial, not least because PSII is extremely sensitive to\\nlight-induced oxidative inactivation ( Aro et al., 1993 ;Yokthongwattana\\nand Melis, 2006 ). PSI is also susceptible to light-induced inhibition,\\nparticularly at low temperatures or under high light, and this has\\nFig. 3.

Foyer Environmental and Experimental Botany 154 (2018) 134–142\\n137consequences for photosynthetic carbon ﬁxation and cell signaling\\n(Gollan et al., 2017). Photosynthetic regulation is designed to protect\\nthe system, while maintaining the balance between energy-producing\\nand energy-consuming processes. Optimizing the e ﬃciency of photo-\\nsynthesis is a priority when light is limiting, allowing e ﬀective use of\\nsolar power and ensuring that metabolism is not limited by energy\\nsupply. Since light is a potentially dangerous substrate, light use must\\nbe carefully managed.\\nElectron transport and formation of ATP and NADPH proceed at\\nmuch slower rates than light harvesting and energy transfer to RCII by\\nantennae ( Ruban et al., 2012 ). As an immediate consequence, the\\namount of energy absorbed recurrently overcomes the metabolic energydemands. This leads to accumulation of excess energy in the thylakoid\\nmembrane that can potentially be harmful to PSII, leading to the per-\\nmanent closure of the PSII reaction centers and photoinhibition, which\\ncan be de ﬁned as a sustained depression of Fv/Fm ratio ( Aro et al.,\\n1993 ). The probability of light-induced inactivation of RCII increases\\nwhen Q\\nAis reduced, i.e., when electron transport away from PSII is\\nlimited. However, the PSII reaction centers are protected by mechan-isms that diminish the rate of excitation of PSII by harmlessly dis-\\nsipating excess energy in the PSII antenna complexes as heat. This\\nprotection is quanti ﬁed by processes that can be assessed from non-\\nphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (NPQ). Several\\nprocesses that contribute to NPQ can be distinguished through their\\nrecovery kinetics. These are the state transition (qT), photoinhibition\\n(qI), heat dissipation (qE) and zeaxanthin-dependent (qZ) quenching\\n(Baker, 2008 ;Jahns and Holzwarth, 2012 ;Ruban et al., 2012 ). Al-\\nthough these NPQ components are kinetically distinct, they haveoverlapping quenching mechanisms and functions ( Logan et al., 2014;\\nDemmig-Adams et al., 2014). The pH-dependent NPQ component thatis typically rapidly reversible in the dark can be maintained in darkness\\nunder conditions that maintain trans-thylakoid pH in darkness. Simi-\\nlarly, the zeaxanthin-correlated NPQ component can be reversed inminutes in some circumstances but can be maintained for days or weeks\\nin darkness under photoinhibitory conditions. The qT component is\\nassociated with redistributing energy absorption between the two\\nphotosystems, which is achieved by the partial detachment and mi-\\ngration of LHCII between PSII and PSI ( Bellaﬁore et al., 2005 ). The qI\\ncomponent is a slowly reversible process and the consequence of pho-toinhibitory events re ﬂecting inactivation of the PS II reaction centres,\\nwhere closed PS II reaction centres protect the open PS II reactioncentres ( Matsubara and Chow 2004 ). The major and fastest component\\nof NPQ, qE, is believed to act in RCII photoprotection, and is related tothe dissipation of excess energy as heat ( Baker, 2008; Ruban et al.,\\n2012 ). More recently described and with a formation/relaxation life-\\ntime in the order of 10– 15 min, qZ is believed to be correlated with the\\nsynthesis and epoxidation of zeaxanthin, and is also related to photo-protection ( Nilkens et al., 2010 ;Jahns and Holzwarth, 2012). The site\\nof qE formation is believed to be the light-harvesting antenna of PSII,triggered by ΔpH and enhanced by violaxanthin de-epoxidation to\\nzeaxanthin (Horton and Ruban, 1992). The protein PsbS was discoveredto play a crucial role in sensing lumen acidi ﬁcation and transducing the\\nsignal to the antenna. Although NPQ is the most commonly en-countered form of PSII regulation, other mechanisms may also be im-\\nportant ( Demmig-Adams and Adams, 2006). However, such assess-\\nments are complicated because multiple pathways contribute tophotoprotection and these operate over di ﬀerent timescales. For ex-\\nample, the pH-dependent NPQ component that is typically rapidly re-versible in the dark can be maintained in darkness if a trans-thylakoid\\npH persists ( Gilmore and Björkman, 1995). Similarly, the zeaxanthin-\\ncorrelated NPQ component can be reversed in minutes in some cir-cumstances and can be maintained for days or weeks in darkness under\\nphotoinhibitory conditions ( Demmig-Adams et al., 2012). Thus, it is not\\ntrivial to measure or quantify the di ﬀerent NPQ components accurately\\nand this has led to a lack of consensus concerning the molecular me-\\nchanisms involved ( Aro et al., 1993 ;Jahns and Holzwarth, 2012 ;Rubanet al., 2012; Tyystjärvi, 2013 ). A new method of NPQ measurement was\\nproposed\\nbyRuban and Murchie (2012) that involves determination of\\nﬂuorescence responses to a gradually increasing actinic light routine.\\nThe yield of chlorophyll ﬂuorescence can then be tracked to provide a\\nmeasure of the onset of photo-inactivation ( Ruban and Murchie, 2012).\\nWhile sustained NPQ formation and zeaxanthin retention have beentypically associated with the degradation of D1 degradation and other\\nPSII proteins in overwintering conifers and other evergreens ( Demmig-\\nAdams et al., 2014), photoinhibitory damage may not be a commonphenomenon in nature ( Foyer et al., 2017). Within this context, pho-\\ntoinhibition may be consequence, rather than a cause, of limited pro-ductivity ( Adams et al., 2013). Stress-induced sustained decreases in\\nFv/Fm ratios are more likely to be related to PSII downregulation viasustained components of protective NPQ and hence should not be used\\nas a measure of damage resulting from photoinhibition ( Foyer et al.,\\n2017 ). Moreover, recent evidence shows that leaves adjust photo-\\nsynthetic e ﬃciency in response to changing irradiance relatively\\nslowly. For example, wheat leaves were shown to take 15 min to regainmaximum photosynthetic e ﬃciency following transfer from shade to\\nsun conditions, the major limitation being the activation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase ( Taylor and Long, 2017).\\nMoreover, decreasing the time required for NPQ relaxation was foundto increase the e ﬃciency of CO\\n2assimilation in tobacco leaves such that\\nproductivity was increased by up to 20% ( Kromdijk et al., 2016). The\\nobserved enhancement of biomass production may not only be due to\\nincreased energy availability as a result of an improved e ﬃciency of\\nphoton capture, but also to an increase in the production of ROS signalsthat stimulate cell expansion and growth ( Demmig-Adams et al., 2018).\\nAn association between increased growth, decreased thermal dissipa-tion and enhanced ROS production is consistent with ﬁndings of\\nEsteban et al. (2009) .\\n4. Chloroplast antioxidants\\nChloroplasts are armed with an elaborate arsenal of antioxidants\\nthat often have overlapping or interacting functions. The function ofchloroplast antioxidants is not to totally eliminate superoxide, H\\n2O2\\nand1O2, but rather to achieve an appropriate balance between pro-\\nduction and removal that is compatible with the operation of photo-\\nsynthesis and yet allows e ﬀective transmission of these redox signals to\\nthe nucleus. Carotenoids such as lutein and zeaxanthin are e ﬀective\\nthylakoid antioxidants located in close proximity to chlorophylls in the\\nlight-harvesting complexes. These pigments are able to quench the\\ntriplet state of chlorophyll (3Chl*) and1O2, resulting in a higher-energy\\ntriplet state (Car*), which can decay to the ground state via di ﬀerent\\nreaction mechanisms such as intersystem crossing, triplet-triplet anni-\\nhilation and ground state quenching ( Burke et al., 2000). The PSII re-\\naction center contains two β-carotene molecules ( Ferreira et al., 2004),\\nwhich are positioned too far from the reaction centre special pair,\\nP680* to allow direct quenching. However, when1O2is generated by\\nP680*, the distance to the β-carotene is close enough to allow oxidative\\nmodiﬁcation of β-carotene and signaling ( Ramel et al., 2012). Toco-\\npherols are also important membrane1O2quenchers, which function as\\ngeneral protectors of thylakoid membranes against lipid peroxidation\\n(Piller et al., 2014). These membrane-bound antioxidants are oxidized\\neither in a one-electron-transfer reaction to a tocopheryl-radical or areoxidized\\n1O2to a hydroperoxide. Both reactions can be reversed by\\nascorbate, which can reduce both the radical and hydroperoxide(Krieger-Liszkay et al., 2008 ). The α−tocopherols in the thylakoid\\nmembranes are also able to terminate chain reactions of PUFA free\\nradicals generated by lipid oxidation. Lipid alkoxyl and peroxyl radicals\\nare reduced to alcohols or hydroperoxides, and chromanoxyl radicals,\\nwhich are all less e ﬃcient in propagation of lipid peroxidation. The\\nchromanoxyl radical may be reduced by ascorbate, thereby re-generating α−tocopherol molecule. While Arabidopsis mutants\\nlacking tocopherol cyclase ( vte1) showed little increase in stressC.H. Foyer Environmental and Experimental Botany 154 (2018) 134–142\\n138sensitivity compared to the wild type, crossing vte1 with the npq1\\nmutant that is deﬁ cient in violaxanthin deepoxidase, the enzyme re-\\nsponsible for the conversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin in the thy-\\nlakoid membrane, resulted in oxidation of lipids and pigments, as well\\nas photoinhibition ( Havaux et al., 2005). In addition to its functions in\\nNPQ, zeaxanthin can function directly as an antioxidant.\\nChloroplasts contain a number of pathways that limit H 2O2accu-\\nmulation ,including the ascorbate-glutathione cycle (Foyer and\\nShigeoka, 2009). In its basic form, this pathway consists of a network of\\nreactions involving APX and enzymes that thereafter serve to re-\\ngenerate ascorbate. APX produces monodehydroascorbate radicals\\n(MDHA), which can then be reduced back to ascorbate by ferredoxin or\\nby NAD(P)H in a reaction catalysed by MDHA reductase (MDHAR;\\nFig. 1A). MDHA that escapes these reactions can spontaneously dis-\\nproportionate to ascorbate and dehydroascorbate (DHA). DHA must\\nthen be recycled to ascorbate in order to avoid depletion of ascorbate.\\nIn chloroplasts, reduced glutathione (GSH) can reduce DHA non-en-\\nzymatically or via the enzyme DHA reductase (DHAR), in a reaction in\\nwhich GSH is oxidized to glutathione disul ﬁde (GSSG). However, an\\nanalysis of Arabidopsis dhar mutants, including DHAR3 that has a\\nchloroplastic location, showed that DHAR activity can be decreased to\\nnegligible levels without marked e ﬀects on the leaf ascorbate pool\\n(Rahantaniaina et al., 2017 ). Intriguingly, the dhar1 dhar2 double\\nmutants showed decreased GSH oxidation in a cat2 background with\\ninhibition of cat2-triggered induction of the salicylic acid and cell death\\npathways. However, these e ﬀects were reversed in the cat2 dhar1 dhar2\\ndhar3 mutant, suggesting the presence of complex redox signaling\\npathways that remain to be elucidated ( Rahantaniaina et al., 2017 ).\\nRecycling of GSSG to GSH is catalysed by glutathione reductase (GR)using NADPH produced by the thylakoid electron transport chain.\\nAnalysis of Arabidopsis mutants lacking both stromal (sAPX) and\\nthylakoid (tAPX) forms of APX, however, revealed that the chloroplasts\\ndo not depended on the ascorbate-glutathione cycle alone to removeH\\n2O2(Giacomelli et al., 2007; Kangasjärvi et al., 2008 ;Maruta et al.,\\n2010 ). In contrast, mutants lacking the thylakoid 2-Cys PRXs ( 2cpa\\n2cpb) had impaired photosynthetic e ﬃciency and showed signs of\\noxidation suggesting that the chloroplast 2-Cys PRXs are essential andperhaps more important than tAPX in preventing H\\n2O2accumulation.\\nHowever, 2-Cys PRXs are also involved in the reduction of reactive lipidperoxides, thus providing additional protection to the chloroplasts.\\nInterestingly, while the 2cpa 2cpb tapx triple mutants showed oxidative\\nstress markers including expression of H\\n2O2-responsive marker genes,\\nleaf H 2O2levels were similar to those measured in the 2cpa 2cpb ( Awad\\net al., 2015 ). These ﬁndings suggest that APXs work together with the\\n2-Cys PRXs and perhaps other systems to remove H 2O2produced by the\\nphotosynthetic electron transport chain and keep stromal H 2O2levels\\nlow ( Awad et al., 2015 ).\\nWhile the mechanisms by which ascorbate is transported into\\nchloroplasts remain to be fully characterized, a member of the phos-phate transporter 4 family (AtPHT4;4) was shown to transport ascor-\\nbate across the envelope membrane ( Miyaji et al., 2015 ) and at least\\none member of the nucleobase ascorbate transporter (NAT) family maybe localized on the thylakoid membrane. Knockout mutants lacking\\nAtPHT4;4 were compromised in thermal energy dissipation ( Miyaji\\net al., 2015 ). In the thylakoid membrane, ascorbate can act as an al-\\nternative electron donor to PSII, and it is also required for the con-\\nversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin in the xanthophyll cycle ( Müller-\\nMoulé et al., 2003 ;Jahns et al., 2009 ). Violaxanthin deepoxidase (VDE)\\nis a luminal enzyme that is active only in its completely oxidized form\\nthat has six disul ﬁde bonds. It is, therefore, possible that this enzyme is\\nregulated by dithiol/disul ﬁde exchange reactions ( Simionato et al.,\\n2015 ). The VDE reaction has a low a ﬃnity for ascorbate. Moreover, the\\naﬃnity of the latter enzyme for ascorbate is strongly pH-dependent\\n(Bratt et al., 1995; Jahns et al., 2009 ). Since chloroplasts contain about\\n10 mM ascorbate ( Zechmann et al., 2011) and VDE requires very high\\nlevels of ascorbate for saturation e.g. 100 mM at pH 6.0 ( Bratt et al.,1995 ;Jahns et al., 2009), it is highly unlikely that these levels are\\nachieved within the thylakoid lumen. The granal thylakoid lumen sig-niﬁcantly expands in the light, allowing better movement of plasto-\\ncyanin and alleviating restrictions imposed on protein di ﬀusion and the\\ntransport of electrons both to and from the cytochrome b6f complex in\\nthis compartment in the dark ( Kirchho ﬀa et al., 2011 ). Nevertheless,\\nmeasured levels of ascorbate within the thylakoid lumen are muchlower than those measured in the stroma ( Zechmann et al., 2011 ;\\nHeyneke et al., 2013). Hence, VDE activity must always be limited byascorbate availability in the wild type even under optimal conditions.\\nThe Arabidopsis vtc2-1 mutants, which have low ascorbate, showed\\nhigher levels of photoinhibition and photooxidation than the wild typeunder high light ( Müller-Moulé et al., 2003, 2014 ). However, other\\nantioxidants such as glutathione are increased to compensate for lowascorbate and maintain antioxidant capacity ( Pastori et al., 2003; Pavet\\net al., 2005 ).\\nAdaptation to biotic and abiotic threats in the environment is\\nthought to have a long-lasting impact on plant processes that is passedto successive generations through persistent epigenetic mechanisms\\nthat provide a pre-emptive advantage. While a growing body of evi-\\ndence suggests that changes in the reduction/oxidation (redox) status of\\nstress signaling molecules and the level of DNA methylation play a\\nmajor role in the transgenerational embedding of stress tolerance, little\\ninformation is available concerning the speci ﬁc pathways and me-\\nchanisms involved. The plant ’s environmental sense and response me-\\nchanism contains a proteome distinct but overlapping with that of the\\nphotosynthetic chloroplast, with several stress proteins, including\\nMSH1, appearing uniquely localized to the sensory plastid.\\n5.\\nChloroplast pathways contribute to epigenetic stress memory\\nin plants\\nChloroplasts are important sensors of environmental change, pro-\\nducing redox and other signals that can be transferred directly, or in-\\ndirectly, to the nucleus to in ﬂuence gene expression leading to accli-\\nmation to prevailing environmental conditions. Redox signals arising inchloroplasts also participate in epigenetic controls ( Dietzel et al., 2015).\\nRecent evidence suggests the presence of speci ﬁc sub-sets of chlor-\\noplasts that specialize in sensory/signaling functions and participate in\\nepigenetic reprogramming ( Virdi et al., 2016 ). This sensory role is\\nhighlighted by analysis of the functions of MUTS HOMOLOG1 (MSH)1,a nucleoid protein that binds DNA and localizes to plastid and mi-\\ntochondrial nucleoids ( Xu et al., 2012 ;Virdi et al., 2016 ). The MSH1\\nprotein, which is unique to plants, is targeted to both the mitochondriaand chloroplasts and ful ﬁls important functions in the induction of\\nepigenetic stress memories in plants. MSH1-associated genetic repro-gramming is a chloroplast-driven process accompanied by mitochon-\\ndrial genomic and epigenetic responses that are intimately associated\\nwith organellar redox changes and stress responses ( Virdi et al., 2016).\\nConsequently, MSH1-containing organelles are considered to functionas sensory plastids ( Virdi et al., 2016 ).\\nAdaptation to the environment has both short term and long-lasting\\nimpacts on plant processes. In some cases, such stress memories are\\npassed to successive generations through persistent epigenetic me-\\nchanisms that provide a pre-emptive advantage in a changing climate.\\nCrucially, cellular redox status is a regulator of the level of DNA me-\\nthylation, which plays a major role in the transgenerational embedding\\nof stress tolerance memories in animals and plants. Reprogramming of\\nthe methylome i.e. the set of nucleic acid methylation modi ﬁcations in\\nthe genome, predisposes the next generation for enhanced stress re-\\nsponses. The redox state of the sensory chloroplast population may also\\nplay a pivotal role in the regulation of such epigenetic controls in\\nplants. The specialized sensory chloroplasts that house the MSH1\\npathway have been found to be localized in the epidermal and vascularparenchyma, as well as in reproductive cells. The sensory chloroplasts,\\nwhich are about 30% of the size of photosynthetic chloroplasts andC.H. Foyer Environmental and Experimental Botany 154 (2018) 134–142\\n139have decreased granal stacking, appear to be otherwise very similar to\\nthe more general chloroplast population, whose main function is pho-\\ntosynthesis, but they contain additional stress proteins, including\\nMSH1, which associates with the thylakoid membrane and plastoglo-\\nbuli ( Virdi et al., 2016 ). Silencing MSH1 produces a strong plant-stress\\nresponse with di ﬀerential expression of genes associated with abiotic\\nand biotic stress pathways, together with genome-wide methylome re-\\npatterning ( Virdi et al., 2015 ). Subsequent segregation of the MSH1-\\nRNAi transgene produced a trans-generational stress memory in 10-25% of progeny, with reduced growth, pale leaves, delayed maturity\\ntransition, delayed ﬂowering, enhanced stress tolerance and altered\\ncircadian rhythms ( Virdi et al., 2015 ). The msh1 memory is stable and\\nheritable inde ﬁnitely.\\nThe sensory function of MSH1 is clearly associated with the redox\\nfunctions of the chloroplasts. It is possible that the MSH1 protein is able\\nto move from the chloroplast to the nucleus, as has been suggested for\\nanother plastid single-stranded DNA-binding protein, WHIRLY1\\n(Grabowski et al., 2008). The partitioning of WHIRLY1 between\\nchloroplasts and nuclei was shown to depend on phosphorylation byCalcineurin BLike-Interacting Protein Kinase14 (CIPK14), providing a\\npotential link between protein phosphorylation, Ca\\n2+signalling and\\nWHIRLY1 functions ( Ren et al., 2017). It is likely that these and other\\nimportant multi-targeted and multifunctional organellar nucleoid pro-\\nteins function in plastid-to-nucleus communication during develop-\\nmental and stress responses, and perhaps passing directly from the\\nchloroplasts to the nuclei ( Caplan et al., 2015).\\n6. Conclusions and perspectives\\nThe driving force for photosynthesis, sunlight, is an almost limitless\\nsupply. Hence, energy conservation is not a key issue for photosynthetic\\nregulation. A sophisticated network of mechanisms that dissipate en-\\nergy are essential to the operation of light harvesting linked to electron\\ntransport in photosynthesis, allowing e ﬀective protection against excess\\nirradiance. The ﬂexibility of photosynthesis has become optimized\\nduring evolution allowing photosynthesis to operate over a wide range\\nof irradiances and environmental variables. The photosynthetic pro-\\ncesses have evolved to be highly plastic and ﬂexible, allowing other\\nprocesses such as ROS production to occur at the expense of e ﬃciency.\\nMultiple layers of overlapping protective systems serve to prevent da-\\nmage to the photosynthetic machinery, via combined action of pre-\\nemptive energy dissipation and ROS removal through antioxidants.\\nGive the requirement to perceive ﬂuctuations in factors that in ﬂuence\\nthe eﬀective operation of photosynthesis in order to regulate these\\nprotective mechanisms, it is not surprising that the chloroplast became\\na major sensor of environmental and metabolic change with the ability\\nto transmit retrograde signals to the nucleus in order to make appro-\\npriate adjustments in gene expression. Direct regulation of plastome\\ngene expression is achieved via activation of protein kinases through\\nthe reduction state of photosynthetic electron transport chain compo-\\nnents, notably plastoquinone and the cytochrome b 6f complex. This\\nregulation extends as far as regulation of nuclear alternative splicing toadjust plant responses to varying light conditions ( Petrillo et al., 2014 ).\\nThis involves regulation of protein kinases located in the thylakoidmembrane and in the stroma that, together with thioredoxin z, control\\nthe function of the plastid polymerase complex ( Allen, 2015). While it is\\nless clear how the redox state of the photosynthetic electron transportchain in ﬂuences the expression of nuclear genes, ROS-related signals\\nare established components of chloroplast-to-nuclear signaling. Theimportance of such communication pathways may have led to furtherspecialization of certain sub-sets of chloroplasts to ful ﬁl a crucial role in\\nthe epigenetic preservation of stress memories.\\nDespite compelling evidence that ROS are pro-life signals with\\nmulti-faceted roles in plant growth and development, the concept thatoxidative damage is a major cause of light-induced loss of cellular\\nfunctions remains prominent in the photosynthesis literature. This maybe in part due to the heavy reliance on measured decreases in Fv/Fmratios as a measure of photoinhibition, without consideration that such\\nchanges may be related to sustained PSII downregulation via protective\\nsystems. Hence, caution should be exercised in the use of Fv/Fm ratios\\nto measure of photo-damage ( Foyer et al., 2017 ).\\nChloroplasts are equipped with an abundance of antioxidants that\\nclearly have overlapping functions as ROS targets. Some of these anti-\\noxidants, such as glutathione and PRX, have well characterized roles in\\nsignal transduction. While others, such as ascorbate, may simply serve\\nto attenuate the ROS signal, the complexity of the chloroplast oxidant\\nand antioxidant system a ﬀords an extensive repertoire of discrete and\\nprobably speci ﬁc redox signals that provides enormous ﬂexibility in the\\ncontrol of gene expression.

It is not surprising therefore that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in\\nabundance by photosynthesis, providing a plethora of redox signals as well as functioning as essential regulatorsof energy and metabolic ﬂuxes. Chloroplasts are equipped with an elaborate and multifaceted protective net-\\nwork that allows photosynthesis to function with high productivity even in resource-limited natural environ-\\nments. This includes numerous antioxidants with overlapping functions that provide enormous ﬂexibility in\\nredox control. ROS are an integral part of the repertoire of chloroplast signals that are transferred to the nucleus\\nto convey essential information concerning redox pressure within the electron transport chain. Current evidence\\nsuggests that there is speci ﬁcity in the gene-expression pro ﬁles triggered by the di ﬀerent ROS signals, so that\\nsinglet oxygen triggers programs related to over excitation of photosystem (PS) II while superoxide and hy-\\ndrogen peroxide promote the expression of other suites of genes that may serve to alleviate electron pressure on\\nthe reducing side of PSI. Not all chloroplasts are equal in their signaling functions, with some sub-populations\\nappearing to have better contacts/access to the nucleus than others to promote genetic and epigenetic responses.While the concept that light-induced increases in ROS result in damage to PSII and photoinhibition is embeddedin the photosynthesis literature, there is little consensus concerning the extent to which such oxidative damage\\nhappens in nature. Slowly reversible decreases in photosynthetic capacity are not necessarily the result of light-\\ninduced damage to PSII reaction centers.\\n1. Introduction\\nElectron ﬂow is the basis of life on earth, whether it is driven by\\nlight in photosynthesis or through chemical redox couples in respira-\\ntion. The incorporation of photosynthesis into eukaryotic cells during\\nevolution not only provided enormous bene ﬁts in terms of energy\\nmetabolism, but also signi ﬁcantly extended the cellular capacity for\\nreduction/oxidation (redox) regulation and signaling. The incorpora-\\ntion of the photosynthetic electron transport chain appears to have been\\naccompanied by a large expansion of protein cysteine thiols used to\\nsense and regulate cellular redox state ( Woehle et al., 2017). The op-\\neration of photosynthesis also resulted in a large increase in the pro-duction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide, hydrogen\\nperoxide and singlet oxygen. The explosion of oxidative signals arising\\nfrom photosynthesis, together with the signi ﬁcant expansion of the\\nredox-sensitive proteome, not only provided cells with mechanisms tomonitor photosynthetic electron ﬂow and thus prevent over-reduction\\nor over-oxidation, but also produced redox regulatory networks thatenable plants to sense and respond to ﬂuctuating environmental con-\\nditions ( Martin and Sies, 2017). While the concept that cells need to\\nmanage ROS production and removal to avoid excessive and irrever-\\nsible oxidation is embed in the animal and plant literature, the con-\\nsensus of opinion is now shifting towards a recognition of the positive\\nroles of ROS as essential pro-life signals ( Noctor and Foyer, 2016 ;Foyer\\net al., 2017 ). Within the complex redox landscape of photosynthetic\\ncells, ROS production is essential for redox sensing, signaling and reg-\\nulation. The best characterized signaling mechanisms involve redox\\nchanges in cysteines either on low-molecular-weight thiols, particularly\\nglutathione, or on proteins thiol groups with oxidation states of the\\nsulphur moieties ranging from thiols ( –RSH) and disul ﬁdes ( –RSSR –)t o\\ntrisulﬁdes and possibly even tetrasul ﬁdes ( Noctor et al., 2011 ). In\\nphotosynthesis, this thiol-disulphide exchange system is used to co-or-\\ndinate the rates of NADP and ATP generation to the rates of their uti-\\nlization in photosynthetic carbon assimilation through the mediation of\\nthioredoxins (TRXs). This extensive network of interactive redox reg-\\nulation occurs together with other post-translational modi ﬁcations\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.05.003\\nReceived 11 April 2018; Received in revised form 3 May 2018; Accepted 3 May 2018E-mail address: c.foyer@leeds.ac.uk .Environmental and E xperimental Botany 154 (2018) 134–142\\nAvailable online 06 May 2018\\n0098-8472/ © 2018 The Author.

Exposure to oxidative stress in ﬂuences two other poorly\\ncharacterized plant PTMs, protein succinylation and acetylation ( Zhou\\net al., 2017 ). This analysis of H 2O2-triggered interactions between the\\nrice leaf lysine succinylome and acetylome revealed speci ﬁceﬀects on\\nphotosynthetic proteins, but the functional signi ﬁcance of these PTMs\\nremains to be established ( Zhou et al., 2017 ). Moreover, the chloroplast\\nthylakoid lumen also contains redo-regulated proteins. Within the\\nlumen, proteins such as the immunophilin, FKBP13, polyphenol oxidase\\nand violaxanthin de-epoxidase, are regulated by oxidative activation\\nfacilitated by the oxygen produced by PSII ( Buchanan & Luan, 2005 ).\\nLight-driven redox changes in the photosynthetic electron transport\\nsystem drive energy conversion that is harnessed in the forms of re-\\nducing power (reduced ferredoxin and NADPH) and ATP. The rate of\\ncarbon assimilation is matched to prevailing electron ﬂuxes through the\\nreduction of TRXs. Reduced TRXs then reduce disulphide bridges ontarget proteins within the Calvin cycle ( Buchanan and Balmer, 2005;\\nNikkanen and Rintamäki, 2014 ). Chloroplasts house a large number of\\ndiﬀerent TRX forms ( Meyer et al., 2012). These TRXs can be reduced by\\ntwo pathways that show some overlap with regard to their target pro-teins ( Nikkanen and Rintamäki, 2014 ;Nikkanen et al., 2017 ). The\\nferredoxin-dependent TRX system is driven by reduced ferredoxinproduced by PSI. Reduced TRX is generated through the mediation of\\nferredoxin-thioredoxin reductases. The pathway is responsible for the\\nlight-induced activation of enzymes of photosynthetic carbon assim-\\nilation ( Michelet et al., 2013 ;Geigenberger and Fernie, 2014), in-\\ncluding fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase), phosphoribulokinase (PRK) and glycer-\\naldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). In addition, this\\npathway regulates the thylakoid chloroplast ATP synthase ( Hisabori\\net al., 2013), the malate-oxaloacetate shuttle ( Scheibe and Dietz, 2012 ),\\nthe ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase step of starch synthesis(Thormählen et al., 2013 ) and the Mg-protoporphyrin methyl-\\ntransferase step in chlorophyll biosynthesis ( Richter et al., 2013). In\\naddition to the ferredoxin-dependent TRX system, there is an NADPH-\\ndependent thioredoxin reductase (NTRC) pathway, which can also ac-\\ntivate the carbon assimilation enzymes either directly or through in-\\nteraction with the ferredoxin-TRX system. The operation of the NTRC\\npathway may be crucial in activating the photosynthetic enzymes under\\nlow light intensities ( Nikkanen et al., 2017).\\nThe ferredoxin-dependent TRX and NTRC systems function together\\nwith 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins (2-Cys PRX) as a two-component hy-\\ndrogen peroxide-detoxifying system under stress conditions ( Perez-Ruiz\\net al., 2006 ;Bernal-Bayard et al., 2014 ). 2-Cys PRXs act together with\\nthe ascorbate-glutathione cycle to limit the accumulation of hydrogen\\nperoxide produced by photosynthesis ( Foyer and Shigeoka, 2011 ). It is\\nalso worthy of note that TRXz is required for the correct assembly of theplastid PEP polymerase and the developmental transition from nuclear-\\nencoded RNA polymerase-driven transcription to PEP-dependent tran-\\nscription of plastid genes, such as psbA that encodes the D1 protein of\\nPSII ( Dietz and Pfannschmidt, 2011). Moreover, TRXx, TRXy and\\nCDSP32 are important in chloroplast responses to oxidative stress(Collin et al., 2003, 2004 ;Broin et al., 2002 ). ROS accumulation within\\nchloroplasts is controlled by a complex antioxidant-scavenging system(Foyer and Shigeoka, 2011 ) that includes TRXs and 2-Cys PRXs as well\\nas\\nantioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and as-\\ncorbate peroxidase (APX), and low molecular weight antioxidants, such\\nas ascorbate ( Fig. 1A) that also play roles in transmitting oxidative\\nsignals as well as controlling ROS accumulation ( Foyer et al., 2017;\\nNoctor et al., 2017 ).\\nFor many years, the dominant concept in redox signaling has been\\nthat cells balance ROS on one side and antioxidants on the other\\n(Noctor et al., 2017 ). According to this concept, oxidative signaling\\nshifts this balance such that ROS accumulate, either through an increasein their production or a decrease in antioxidant capacity. This conceptsuggests that, when ROS are low, cell signaling entrains acclimation\\nand improved stress tolerance and that, when ROS are in excess of\\nantioxidant capacity, the resulting enhanced oxidation causes damage\\nand entrains programmed cell death. While this concept continues to be\\nuseful, recent work suggests that it needs to be updated, notably to take\\naccount of the complexity and speci ﬁcity of plant antioxidative systems\\nas well as their roles in signaling ( Fig. 1B). It has, therefore, been\\nsuggested that “ROS processing systems ”would be a more accurate\\nterm than “antioxidative systems ”to describe cellular components that\\nare most likely to interact with ROS and, in doing so, transmit oxidative\\nsignals ( Noctor et al., 2017 ). The direction of signal ﬂow will depend on\\nfactors such as the proximity of the ROS target, its relative susceptibilityto oxidation and its abundance in relation to other targets. In this way,\\noxidative signals may have a high level of speci ﬁcity in a ROS-de-\\ntermined wheel of cell fortune or fate. Within this context, redox signalsarising from the chloroplasts will readily interact with components of\\nthe phytohormone signaling network to regulate plant growth and de-\\nfense pathways in response to a changing environment ( Bartoli et al.,\\n2013 ).\\n2. ROS formation in chloroplasts\\nOxygen is an important electron acceptor in photosynthesis. The\\nreduction of molecular oxygen by PSI in the Mehler reaction is a cou-\\npled process leading to the formation of ATP without NADPH. Oxygen\\nreduction provides an alternative electron sink and generates super-\\noxide anion radicals that are converted to H\\n2O2by the action of the\\nthylakoid copper/zinc SODs. H 2O2can then be reduced to water by\\nchloroplast APXs and the PRXs ( Awad et al., 2015). In the overall\\nprocess, known as the water-water cycle, two electrons are used to\\nproduce H 2O2and two are required to metabolize H 2O2to water, al-\\nlowing the dissipation of excess excitation energy and electrons ( Foyer\\net al., 1991; Osmond and Grace, 1995 ;Asada, 2000 ). While this process\\nmay only make a minor contribution to thylakoid acidi ﬁcation and the\\ncontrol of PSII activity because it is saturated at relatively low irra-\\ndiances ( Heber, 2002; Driever and Baker, 2011 ), it is undoubtedly an\\nimportant source of oxidative signals that may be directly or indirectlybe transferred to the nucleus ( Fey et al., 2005 ;Noctor and Foyer, 2016;\\nExposito-Rodriguez et al., 2007). One possibility is that H\\n2O2generated\\nby photosynthesis may be directly transferred to the nucleus from at-\\ntached chloroplasts ( Fig. 2 ;Exposito-Rodriguez et al., 2007 ). Thus, the\\nMehler reaction might itself function as a signaling mechanism, withH\\n2O2production acting as a measure of electron transport activity\\n(Exposito-Rodriguez et al., 2007). Another mechanism of direct transfer\\nof H 2O2to the nucleus is via stromules ( Fig. 3 ;Caplan et al., 2015 ).\\nIt is now well-established that ROS are key components of chlor-\\noplast-nucleus retrograde signaling pathways, working together with a\\ncomplex array of putative retrograde signaling molecules including\\nmetabolites and mobile transcription factors, calcium and links to\\npathways such as the unfolded protein response. Of these, the 3 ′-\\nphosphoadenosine 5′ -phosphate (PAP) phosphatase called SAL1 is\\nperhaps the best characterized; SAL1 is thought to act as a sensor of\\noxidative stress in the chloroplasts because it undergoes a conforma-\\ntional change in response to redox changes. Chloroplast oxidation re-\\nsults in deactivation of SAL1 and accumulation of its substrate PAP,\\nwhich acts as plastid signal instigating chloroplast-to-nucleus retro-\\ngrade signaling pathways ( Chan et al., 2016). It should be noted that\\nredox changes in other cellular compartments may inﬂ uence the sus-\\nceptibility of photosynthesis to high-light-induced inhibition and also\\nmodulate chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling and the transcriptional re-sponses of leaves to high light ( Karpinska et al., 2017a, 2017b ). Su-\\nperoxide and H\\n2O2are relatively weak oxidants. Superoxide has re-\\nceived little attention with regard to chloroplast processes because it\\nhas no reactivity to most biological molecules and is rapidly converted\\nto H 2O2by the action of thylakoid and stromal SODs. Superoxide in-\\nteracts with nitric oxide (NO) and it is also reduced to H 2O2by ascorbicC.H.

In the mitochondria, super-\\noxide is able to inactivate the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme aconitase,\\nwhich is a sensitive target in the matrix, but it has not been shown to\\ncause inhibition of Calvin cycle enzymes that, in contrast, are very\\nsusceptible to oxidation and inactivation by H 2O2. Hence, plastid H 2O2\\nlevels have to be very low and in the micromolar range. It is worthy ofnote that H\\n2O2and superoxide have divergent e ﬀects on cell survival\\nand programmed cell suicide pathways in animals, where H 2O2pro-\\nmotes and superoxide inhibits cell death programs and apoptotic sig-\\nnaling ( Pervaiz and Clement, 2007 ). It may be that superoxide also\\npromotes cell survival in plants, particularly in light of observations ofspatiotemporal patterns superoxide and H\\n2O2in root meristems ( Foyeret al., 2018). The short lifetimes of superoxide and singlet oxygen makethem unlikely candidates to di ﬀuse over any distances within the cell.\\nIn contrast, H\\n2O2is more stable and is thus the most likely ROS form to\\nact as a mobile signal (Foyer and Noctor, 2016).\\nChloroplast ROS are essential signals underpinning acclimation re-\\nsponses through retrograde signaling to the nucleus, and they are also\\ncomponents of whole-plant systemic signaling pathways. The small\\nplastids of the vascular parenchyma and also bundle-sheath plastids\\nfulﬁl signaling functions that regulate mesophyll plastid development\\n(Lundquist et al., 2014 ;Petrillo et al., 2014 ). Phytochrome B-mediated\\nauxin pathways transmit signals perceived by apical leaves to increasethe speed of induction of photosynthesis in distal leaves ( Guo et al.,\\n2016 ). This pathway, which transmits information concerning high\\nlight perceived at the apex, results in stimulation of H\\n2O2production in\\nsystemic leaves that are distant from the apical leaves [?] leading toincreased cyclic electron ﬂow around PSI during photosynthetic in-\\nduction ( Guo et al., 2016 ). Moreover, altering the ascorbate/DHA ratio\\nof the apoplast/cell wall compartment by manipulating ascorbate oxi-\\ndase activities was su ﬃcient to alter the ability of photosynthesis to\\nacclimate to high light ( Karpinska et al., 2017a ). Tobacco leaves with\\nlow ascorbate oxidase activities maintained higher photosynthesis rates\\nunder high light than wild type controls or plants with high ascorbate\\noxidase activities ( Karpinska et al., 2017a ). Taken together, such ﬁnd-\\nings demonstrate that photosynthesis is not only responsive to ROSproduced directly in the chloroplasts, but also to oxidants generated in\\nother parts of the cell or via phytohormone-mediated pathways to allow\\nacclimation to local and systemic cues ( Bartoli et al., 2013).\\nIn contrast to H\\n2O2, singlet oxygen (1O2), is a powerful oxidant that\\nreacts rapidly with macromolecules in the vicinity of where it is gen-\\nerated, resulting in oxidation that is often referred to as “damage” (Apel\\nand Hirt, 2004; Watabe et al., 2007 ).

The vulnerability of PSII to oxidative damage/inactivation\\nmeans that each reaction center has to be rebuilt several times an hour,\\neven under optimal irradiances. Oxidative modi ﬁcations to the D1 and\\nD2 proteins increase reaction center turnover ( Malnoë et al., 2014). It is\\npossible that the breakdown products of D1 protein might ful ﬁl sig-\\nnaling roles, but this has not as yet been demonstrated in higher plants.The subunits of the oxygen-evolving complex are also prone to ROS-\\nmediated damage/modi ﬁcation ( Henmi et al., 2004). Any damaged/\\ninactivated subunits are removed by luminal proteases that degradedamaged/inactivated components during the repair cycle, in which\\nnewly synthesized subunits are shuttled from the stroma lamellae,\\nwhere they are inserted into the thylakoids, to the granal thylakoids.\\nSinglet oxygen can also impair de novo synthesis of D1 by targeting the\\nprotein elongation factor G (CpEF-G) ( Nishiyama et al., 2006 ). D1 is co-\\ntranslationally inserted into PSII during repair via the cpSECY trans-\\nlocase ( Nilsson and van Wijk, 2002 ). However,\\n1O2would have to\\ndiﬀuse over a considerable distance if it were to target the elongation\\nfactors, and there are many other susceptible molecules in the thylakoidsystem, particularly poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and other\\nmembrane lipids ( Przybyla et al., 2008 ). These peroxidation products\\nare generated in a singlet oxygen-dependent fashion in plants exposedto high light and other stresses ( Triantaphylidès et al., 2008). Lipid\\nperoxidation, accompanied by the generation of oxylipins, is oftentaken to be a signature of photo-oxidative damage ( Girotti, 2001;\\nMueller et al., 2006 ;Przybyla et al., 2008). Moreover, excessive lipid\\nperoxidation, leading to the apparent bursting of the chloroplast\\nmembranes, is often considered by the basis for the “accidental cell\\ndeath ”phenomena described in mutants such as ﬂuand ch1(Laloi and\\nHavaux, 2015). However, chloroplasts contain many\\n1O2scavengers,\\nincluding β-carotene ascorbate, tocopherol and glutathione that pre-\\nvent such negative outcomes. Moreover, photo-protective mechanisms\\nare deployed in order to protect the photosynthetic antenna complexes\\nfrom over-excitation, when the absorption of light intensity exceeds the\\ncapacity of photochemistry to use the absorbed energy.\\nSuperoxide and hydrogen peroxide are largely generated at PSI on\\nthe stromal side of non-appressed thylakoid membranes. Singlet oxygen\\nis generated by PSII in the grana core and also by the PSII repair process\\noccurring on non-appressed margins of the grana ( Wang et al., 2016 ).\\nAccumulating evidence suggests that hydrogen peroxide and singletoxygen function as separate redox signals that are transduced by dif-\\nferent pathways to trigger the expression of speci ﬁc suites of nuclear\\ngenes. Two distinct\\n1O2−triggered chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling\\npathways have been described to date: ﬁrstly,1O2may modify gene\\nexpression through interaction with β-carotene and the generation of\\ncarotenoid breakdown products ( β-CC), some of which are volatile\\n(Ramel et al., 2012 ); secondly, the nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteinEXECUTER (EX)1 plays an essential role together with EX2 in the\\ntransmission of1O2signals ( Apel and Hirt, 2004 ;Lee et al., 2007 ,op\\nden Camp et al., 2003; Wagner et al., 2004 ,Wang et al., 2016 ). The β-\\nCC-induced and EX1-dependent pathways have only a small number of\\ncommon1O2−responsive genes, suggesting that the two pathways are\\nseparate ( Dogra et al., 2017 ). Moreover, β-CC-mediated signaling is\\nindependent of EX1/EX2 ( Ramel et al., 2013 ;Shumbe et al., 2016 ). The\\nEX1 and EX2 proteins are required for the local and systemic signalingpathways leading to gene expression changes that underpin acclimation\\nto stress caused by high light ( Carmody et al., 2016 ). The EX1 proteins\\nare mostly localized in the non-appressed margins of the grana, sug-gesting that EX1 transmits signals from\\n1O2produced in the grana\\nmargins ( Wang et al., 2016 ), where the repair of damaged/inactivated\\nPSII reaction centers (RCII) takes place through disassembly and de-\\ngradation of damaged/inactivated proteins by the membrane-bound\\nFtsH protease. EX1 is associated with RCII proteins, including D1 and\\nD2, and FtsH2 proteases, as well as with protein-elongation factors and\\nchlorophyll biosynthetic enzymes ( Wang et al., 2016). In contrast, β-\\ncarotene is likely to be more important in quenching1O2produced in\\nthe grana core ( Ramel et al., 2012, 2013 ).\\nPerception of1O2signals induces cell suicide programs in seedlings\\nand leads to growth inhibition in mature plants ( Wagner et al., 2004).\\nPhytohormones such as salicylic acid and jasmonate act as important\\npromoters or inhibitors of cell death in the ﬂuorescent (ﬂu) and chlorina\\n1(ch1) mutants, acting as key players in the decision between accli-\\nmation and cell death as they do in H 2O2–mediated induction of pro-\\ngrammed cell death observed in catalase (cat)2 mutants ( Mhamdi et al.,\\n2010, 2012 ). The FLU protein acts as a negative feedback regulator in\\nthe Mg-branch of the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway in the dark. Theﬂumutants accumulate the chloroplast precursor protochlorophyllide\\n(Pchlide) in the dark because conversion of Pchlide to Chlorophyllide islight-dependent. Pchlide molecules are potent photosensitizers that\\ngenerate\\n1O2in abundance upon illumination ( Meskauskiene et al.,\\n2001 ).\\n3.

Plants cannot easily turn o ﬀphotosystem chemistry and this\\nﬂexibility is thus crucial, not least because PSII is extremely sensitive to\\nlight-induced oxidative inactivation ( Aro et al., 1993 ;Yokthongwattana\\nand Melis, 2006 ). PSI is also susceptible to light-induced inhibition,\\nparticularly at low temperatures or under high light, and this has\\nFig. 3.

Photosynthetic regulation is designed to protect\\nthe system, while maintaining the balance between energy-producing\\nand energy-consuming processes. Optimizing the e ﬃciency of photo-\\nsynthesis is a priority when light is limiting, allowing e ﬀective use of\\nsolar power and ensuring that metabolism is not limited by energy\\nsupply. Since light is a potentially dangerous substrate, light use must\\nbe carefully managed.\\nElectron transport and formation of ATP and NADPH proceed at\\nmuch slower rates than light harvesting and energy transfer to RCII by\\nantennae ( Ruban et al., 2012 ). As an immediate consequence, the\\namount of energy absorbed recurrently overcomes the metabolic energydemands. This leads to accumulation of excess energy in the thylakoid\\nmembrane that can potentially be harmful to PSII, leading to the per-\\nmanent closure of the PSII reaction centers and photoinhibition, which\\ncan be de ﬁned as a sustained depression of Fv/Fm ratio ( Aro et al.,\\n1993 ). The probability of light-induced inactivation of RCII increases\\nwhen Q\\nAis reduced, i.e., when electron transport away from PSII is\\nlimited. However, the PSII reaction centers are protected by mechan-isms that diminish the rate of excitation of PSII by harmlessly dis-\\nsipating excess energy in the PSII antenna complexes as heat. This\\nprotection is quanti ﬁed by processes that can be assessed from non-\\nphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll ﬂuorescence (NPQ). Several\\nprocesses that contribute to NPQ can be distinguished through their\\nrecovery kinetics. These are the state transition (qT), photoinhibition\\n(qI), heat dissipation (qE) and zeaxanthin-dependent (qZ) quenching\\n(Baker, 2008 ;Jahns and Holzwarth, 2012 ;Ruban et al., 2012 ). Al-\\nthough these NPQ components are kinetically distinct, they haveoverlapping quenching mechanisms and functions ( Logan et al., 2014;\\nDemmig-Adams et al., 2014). The pH-dependent NPQ component thatis typically rapidly reversible in the dark can be maintained in darkness\\nunder conditions that maintain trans-thylakoid pH in darkness. Simi-\\nlarly, the zeaxanthin-correlated NPQ component can be reversed inminutes in some circumstances but can be maintained for days or weeks\\nin darkness under photoinhibitory conditions. The qT component is\\nassociated with redistributing energy absorption between the two\\nphotosystems, which is achieved by the partial detachment and mi-\\ngration of LHCII between PSII and PSI ( Bellaﬁore et al., 2005 ). The qI\\ncomponent is a slowly reversible process and the consequence of pho-toinhibitory events re ﬂecting inactivation of the PS II reaction centres,\\nwhere closed PS II reaction centres protect the open PS II reactioncentres ( Matsubara and Chow 2004 ). The major and fastest component\\nof NPQ, qE, is believed to act in RCII photoprotection, and is related tothe dissipation of excess energy as heat ( Baker, 2008; Ruban et al.,\\n2012 ). More recently described and with a formation/relaxation life-\\ntime in the order of 10– 15 min, qZ is believed to be correlated with the\\nsynthesis and epoxidation of zeaxanthin, and is also related to photo-protection ( Nilkens et al., 2010 ;Jahns and Holzwarth, 2012). The site\\nof qE formation is believed to be the light-harvesting antenna of PSII,triggered by ΔpH and enhanced by violaxanthin de-epoxidation to\\nzeaxanthin (Horton and Ruban, 1992). The protein PsbS was discoveredto play a crucial role in sensing lumen acidi ﬁcation and transducing the\\nsignal to the antenna. Although NPQ is the most commonly en-countered form of PSII regulation, other mechanisms may also be im-\\nportant ( Demmig-Adams and Adams, 2006). However, such assess-\\nments are complicated because multiple pathways contribute tophotoprotection and these operate over di ﬀerent timescales. For ex-\\nample, the pH-dependent NPQ component that is typically rapidly re-versible in the dark can be maintained in darkness if a trans-thylakoid\\npH persists ( Gilmore and Björkman, 1995). Similarly, the zeaxanthin-\\ncorrelated NPQ component can be reversed in minutes in some cir-cumstances and can be maintained for days or weeks in darkness under\\nphotoinhibitory conditions ( Demmig-Adams et al., 2012). Thus, it is not\\ntrivial to measure or quantify the di ﬀerent NPQ components accurately\\nand this has led to a lack of consensus concerning the molecular me-\\nchanisms involved ( Aro et al., 1993 ;Jahns and Holzwarth, 2012 ;Rubanet al., 2012; Tyystjärvi, 2013 ). A new method of NPQ measurement was\\nproposed\\nbyRuban and Murchie (2012) that involves determination of\\nﬂuorescence responses to a gradually increasing actinic light routine.\\nThe yield of chlorophyll ﬂuorescence can then be tracked to provide a\\nmeasure of the onset of photo-inactivation ( Ruban and Murchie, 2012).\\nWhile sustained NPQ formation and zeaxanthin retention have beentypically associated with the degradation of D1 degradation and other\\nPSII proteins in overwintering conifers and other evergreens ( Demmig-\\nAdams et al., 2014), photoinhibitory damage may not be a commonphenomenon in nature ( Foyer et al., 2017). Within this context, pho-\\ntoinhibition may be consequence, rather than a cause, of limited pro-ductivity ( Adams et al., 2013). Stress-induced sustained decreases in\\nFv/Fm ratios are more likely to be related to PSII downregulation viasustained components of protective NPQ and hence should not be used\\nas a measure of damage resulting from photoinhibition ( Foyer et al.,\\n2017 ). Moreover, recent evidence shows that leaves adjust photo-\\nsynthetic e ﬃciency in response to changing irradiance relatively\\nslowly. For example, wheat leaves were shown to take 15 min to regainmaximum photosynthetic e ﬃciency following transfer from shade to\\nsun conditions, the major limitation being the activation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase ( Taylor and Long, 2017).\\nMoreover, decreasing the time required for NPQ relaxation was foundto increase the e ﬃciency of CO\\n2assimilation in tobacco leaves such that\\nproductivity was increased by up to 20% ( Kromdijk et al., 2016). The\\nobserved enhancement of biomass production may not only be due to\\nincreased energy availability as a result of an improved e ﬃciency of\\nphoton capture, but also to an increase in the production of ROS signalsthat stimulate cell expansion and growth ( Demmig-Adams et al., 2018).\\nAn association between increased growth, decreased thermal dissipa-tion and enhanced ROS production is consistent with ﬁndings of\\nEsteban et al. (2009) .\\n4. Chloroplast antioxidants\\nChloroplasts are armed with an elaborate arsenal of antioxidants\\nthat often have overlapping or interacting functions. The function ofchloroplast antioxidants is not to totally eliminate superoxide, H\\n2O2\\nand1O2, but rather to achieve an appropriate balance between pro-\\nduction and removal that is compatible with the operation of photo-\\nsynthesis and yet allows e ﬀective transmission of these redox signals to\\nthe nucleus. Carotenoids such as lutein and zeaxanthin are e ﬀective\\nthylakoid antioxidants located in close proximity to chlorophylls in the\\nlight-harvesting complexes. These pigments are able to quench the\\ntriplet state of chlorophyll (3Chl*) and1O2, resulting in a higher-energy\\ntriplet state (Car*), which can decay to the ground state via di ﬀerent\\nreaction mechanisms such as intersystem crossing, triplet-triplet anni-\\nhilation and ground state quenching ( Burke et al., 2000). The PSII re-\\naction center contains two β-carotene molecules ( Ferreira et al., 2004),\\nwhich are positioned too far from the reaction centre special pair,\\nP680* to allow direct quenching. However, when1O2is generated by\\nP680*, the distance to the β-carotene is close enough to allow oxidative\\nmodiﬁcation of β-carotene and signaling ( Ramel et al., 2012). Toco-\\npherols are also important membrane1O2quenchers, which function as\\ngeneral protectors of thylakoid membranes against lipid peroxidation\\n(Piller et al., 2014). These membrane-bound antioxidants are oxidized\\neither in a one-electron-transfer reaction to a tocopheryl-radical or areoxidized\\n1O2to a hydroperoxide. Both reactions can be reversed by\\nascorbate, which can reduce both the radical and hydroperoxide(Krieger-Liszkay et al., 2008 ). The α−tocopherols in the thylakoid\\nmembranes are also able to terminate chain reactions of PUFA free\\nradicals generated by lipid oxidation. Lipid alkoxyl and peroxyl radicals\\nare reduced to alcohols or hydroperoxides, and chromanoxyl radicals,\\nwhich are all less e ﬃcient in propagation of lipid peroxidation. The\\nchromanoxyl radical may be reduced by ascorbate, thereby re-generating α−tocopherol molecule. While Arabidopsis mutants\\nlacking tocopherol cyclase ( vte1) showed little increase in stressC.H. Foyer Environmental and Experimental Botany 154 (2018) 134–142\\n138sensitivity compared to the wild type, crossing vte1 with the npq1\\nmutant that is deﬁ cient in violaxanthin deepoxidase, the enzyme re-\\nsponsible for the conversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin in the thy-\\nlakoid membrane, resulted in oxidation of lipids and pigments, as well\\nas photoinhibition ( Havaux et al., 2005). In addition to its functions in\\nNPQ, zeaxanthin can function directly as an antioxidant.\\nChloroplasts contain a number of pathways that limit H 2O2accu-\\nmulation ,including the ascorbate-glutathione cycle (Foyer and\\nShigeoka, 2009). In its basic form, this pathway consists of a network of\\nreactions involving APX and enzymes that thereafter serve to re-\\ngenerate ascorbate. APX produces monodehydroascorbate radicals\\n(MDHA), which can then be reduced back to ascorbate by ferredoxin or\\nby NAD(P)H in a reaction catalysed by MDHA reductase (MDHAR;\\nFig. 1A). MDHA that escapes these reactions can spontaneously dis-\\nproportionate to ascorbate and dehydroascorbate (DHA). DHA must\\nthen be recycled to ascorbate in order to avoid depletion of ascorbate.\\nIn chloroplasts, reduced glutathione (GSH) can reduce DHA non-en-\\nzymatically or via the enzyme DHA reductase (DHAR), in a reaction in\\nwhich GSH is oxidized to glutathione disul ﬁde (GSSG). However, an\\nanalysis of Arabidopsis dhar mutants, including DHAR3 that has a\\nchloroplastic location, showed that DHAR activity can be decreased to\\nnegligible levels without marked e ﬀects on the leaf ascorbate pool\\n(Rahantaniaina et al., 2017 ). Intriguingly, the dhar1 dhar2 double\\nmutants showed decreased GSH oxidation in a cat2 background with\\ninhibition of cat2-triggered induction of the salicylic acid and cell death\\npathways. However, these e ﬀects were reversed in the cat2 dhar1 dhar2\\ndhar3 mutant, suggesting the presence of complex redox signaling\\npathways that remain to be elucidated ( Rahantaniaina et al., 2017 ).\\nRecycling of GSSG to GSH is catalysed by glutathione reductase (GR)using NADPH produced by the thylakoid electron transport chain.\\nAnalysis of Arabidopsis mutants lacking both stromal (sAPX) and\\nthylakoid (tAPX) forms of APX, however, revealed that the chloroplasts\\ndo not depended on the ascorbate-glutathione cycle alone to removeH\\n2O2(Giacomelli et al., 2007; Kangasjärvi et al., 2008 ;Maruta et al.,\\n2010 ). In contrast, mutants lacking the thylakoid 2-Cys PRXs ( 2cpa\\n2cpb) had impaired photosynthetic e ﬃciency and showed signs of\\noxidation suggesting that the chloroplast 2-Cys PRXs are essential andperhaps more important than tAPX in preventing H\\n2O2accumulation.\\nHowever, 2-Cys PRXs are also involved in the reduction of reactive lipidperoxides, thus providing additional protection to the chloroplasts.\\nInterestingly, while the 2cpa 2cpb tapx triple mutants showed oxidative\\nstress markers including expression of H\\n2O2-responsive marker genes,\\nleaf H 2O2levels were similar to those measured in the 2cpa 2cpb ( Awad\\net al., 2015 ). These ﬁndings suggest that APXs work together with the\\n2-Cys PRXs and perhaps other systems to remove H 2O2produced by the\\nphotosynthetic electron transport chain and keep stromal H 2O2levels\\nlow ( Awad et al., 2015 ).\\nWhile the mechanisms by which ascorbate is transported into\\nchloroplasts remain to be fully characterized, a member of the phos-phate transporter 4 family (AtPHT4;4) was shown to transport ascor-\\nbate across the envelope membrane ( Miyaji et al., 2015 ) and at least\\none member of the nucleobase ascorbate transporter (NAT) family maybe localized on the thylakoid membrane. Knockout mutants lacking\\nAtPHT4;4 were compromised in thermal energy dissipation ( Miyaji\\net al., 2015 ). In the thylakoid membrane, ascorbate can act as an al-\\nternative electron donor to PSII, and it is also required for the con-\\nversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin in the xanthophyll cycle ( Müller-\\nMoulé et al., 2003 ;Jahns et al., 2009 ). Violaxanthin deepoxidase (VDE)\\nis a luminal enzyme that is active only in its completely oxidized form\\nthat has six disul ﬁde bonds. It is, therefore, possible that this enzyme is\\nregulated by dithiol/disul ﬁde exchange reactions ( Simionato et al.,\\n2015 ). The VDE reaction has a low a ﬃnity for ascorbate. Moreover, the\\naﬃnity of the latter enzyme for ascorbate is strongly pH-dependent\\n(Bratt et al., 1995; Jahns et al., 2009 ). Since chloroplasts contain about\\n10 mM ascorbate ( Zechmann et al., 2011) and VDE requires very high\\nlevels of ascorbate for saturation e.g. 100 mM at pH 6.0 ( Bratt et al.,1995 ;Jahns et al., 2009), it is highly unlikely that these levels are\\nachieved within the thylakoid lumen. The granal thylakoid lumen sig-niﬁcantly expands in the light, allowing better movement of plasto-\\ncyanin and alleviating restrictions imposed on protein di ﬀusion and the\\ntransport of electrons both to and from the cytochrome b6f complex in\\nthis compartment in the dark ( Kirchho ﬀa et al., 2011 ). Nevertheless,\\nmeasured levels of ascorbate within the thylakoid lumen are muchlower than those measured in the stroma ( Zechmann et al., 2011 ;\\nHeyneke et al., 2013). Hence, VDE activity must always be limited byascorbate availability in the wild type even under optimal conditions.\\nThe Arabidopsis vtc2-1 mutants, which have low ascorbate, showed\\nhigher levels of photoinhibition and photooxidation than the wild typeunder high light ( Müller-Moulé et al., 2003, 2014 ). However, other\\nantioxidants such as glutathione are increased to compensate for lowascorbate and maintain antioxidant capacity ( Pastori et al., 2003; Pavet\\net al., 2005 ).\\nAdaptation to biotic and abiotic threats in the environment is\\nthought to have a long-lasting impact on plant processes that is passedto successive generations through persistent epigenetic mechanisms\\nthat provide a pre-emptive advantage. While a growing body of evi-\\ndence suggests that changes in the reduction/oxidation (redox) status of\\nstress signaling molecules and the level of DNA methylation play a\\nmajor role in the transgenerational embedding of stress tolerance, little\\ninformation is available concerning the speci ﬁc pathways and me-\\nchanisms involved. The plant ’s environmental sense and response me-\\nchanism contains a proteome distinct but overlapping with that of the\\nphotosynthetic chloroplast, with several stress proteins, including\\nMSH1, appearing uniquely localized to the sensory plastid.\\n5.\\nChloroplast pathways contribute to epigenetic stress memory\\nin plants\\nChloroplasts are important sensors of environmental change, pro-\\nducing redox and other signals that can be transferred directly, or in-\\ndirectly, to the nucleus to in ﬂuence gene expression leading to accli-\\nmation to prevailing environmental conditions. Redox signals arising inchloroplasts also participate in epigenetic controls ( Dietzel et al., 2015).\\nRecent evidence suggests the presence of speci ﬁc sub-sets of chlor-\\noplasts that specialize in sensory/signaling functions and participate in\\nepigenetic reprogramming ( Virdi et al., 2016 ). This sensory role is\\nhighlighted by analysis of the functions of MUTS HOMOLOG1 (MSH)1,a nucleoid protein that binds DNA and localizes to plastid and mi-\\ntochondrial nucleoids ( Xu et al., 2012 ;Virdi et al., 2016 ). The MSH1\\nprotein, which is unique to plants, is targeted to both the mitochondriaand chloroplasts and ful ﬁls important functions in the induction of\\nepigenetic stress memories in plants. MSH1-associated genetic repro-gramming is a chloroplast-driven process accompanied by mitochon-\\ndrial genomic and epigenetic responses that are intimately associated\\nwith organellar redox changes and stress responses ( Virdi et al., 2016).\\nConsequently, MSH1-containing organelles are considered to functionas sensory plastids ( Virdi et al., 2016 ).\\nAdaptation to the environment has both short term and long-lasting\\nimpacts on plant processes. In some cases, such stress memories are\\npassed to successive generations through persistent epigenetic me-\\nchanisms that provide a pre-emptive advantage in a changing climate.\\nCrucially, cellular redox status is a regulator of the level of DNA me-\\nthylation, which plays a major role in the transgenerational embedding\\nof stress tolerance memories in animals and plants. Reprogramming of\\nthe methylome i.e. the set of nucleic acid methylation modi ﬁcations in\\nthe genome, predisposes the next generation for enhanced stress re-\\nsponses. The redox state of the sensory chloroplast population may also\\nplay a pivotal role in the regulation of such epigenetic controls in\\nplants. The specialized sensory chloroplasts that house the MSH1\\npathway have been found to be localized in the epidermal and vascularparenchyma, as well as in reproductive cells. The sensory chloroplasts,\\nwhich are about 30% of the size of photosynthetic chloroplasts andC.H. Foyer Environmental and Experimental Botany 154 (2018) 134–142\\n139have decreased granal stacking, appear to be otherwise very similar to\\nthe more general chloroplast population, whose main function is pho-\\ntosynthesis, but they contain additional stress proteins, including\\nMSH1, which associates with the thylakoid membrane and plastoglo-\\nbuli ( Virdi et al., 2016 ). Silencing MSH1 produces a strong plant-stress\\nresponse with di ﬀerential expression of genes associated with abiotic\\nand biotic stress pathways, together with genome-wide methylome re-\\npatterning ( Virdi et al., 2015 ). Subsequent segregation of the MSH1-\\nRNAi transgene produced a trans-generational stress memory in 10-25% of progeny, with reduced growth, pale leaves, delayed maturity\\ntransition, delayed ﬂowering, enhanced stress tolerance and altered\\ncircadian rhythms ( Virdi et al., 2015 ). The msh1 memory is stable and\\nheritable inde ﬁnitely.\\nThe sensory function of MSH1 is clearly associated with the redox\\nfunctions of the chloroplasts. It is possible that the MSH1 protein is able\\nto move from the chloroplast to the nucleus, as has been suggested for\\nanother plastid single-stranded DNA-binding protein, WHIRLY1\\n(Grabowski et al., 2008). The partitioning of WHIRLY1 between\\nchloroplasts and nuclei was shown to depend on phosphorylation byCalcineurin BLike-Interacting Protein Kinase14 (CIPK14), providing a\\npotential link between protein phosphorylation, Ca\\n2+signalling and\\nWHIRLY1 functions ( Ren et al., 2017). It is likely that these and other\\nimportant multi-targeted and multifunctional organellar nucleoid pro-\\nteins function in plastid-to-nucleus communication during develop-\\nmental and stress responses, and perhaps passing directly from the\\nchloroplasts to the nuclei ( Caplan et al., 2015).\\n6. Conclusions and perspectives\\nThe driving force for photosynthesis, sunlight, is an almost limitless\\nsupply. Hence, energy conservation is not a key issue for photosynthetic\\nregulation. A sophisticated network of mechanisms that dissipate en-\\nergy are essential to the operation of light harvesting linked to electron\\ntransport in photosynthesis, allowing e ﬀective protection against excess\\nirradiance. The ﬂexibility of photosynthesis has become optimized\\nduring evolution allowing photosynthesis to operate over a wide range\\nof irradiances and environmental variables. The photosynthetic pro-\\ncesses have evolved to be highly plastic and ﬂexible, allowing other\\nprocesses such as ROS production to occur at the expense of e ﬃciency.\\nMultiple layers of overlapping protective systems serve to prevent da-\\nmage to the photosynthetic machinery, via combined action of pre-\\nemptive energy dissipation and ROS removal through antioxidants.\\nGive the requirement to perceive ﬂuctuations in factors that in ﬂuence\\nthe eﬀective operation of photosynthesis in order to regulate these\\nprotective mechanisms, it is not surprising that the chloroplast became\\na major sensor of environmental and metabolic change with the ability\\nto transmit retrograde signals to the nucleus in order to make appro-\\npriate adjustments in gene expression. Direct regulation of plastome\\ngene expression is achieved via activation of protein kinases through\\nthe reduction state of photosynthetic electron transport chain compo-\\nnents, notably plastoquinone and the cytochrome b 6f complex. This\\nregulation extends as far as regulation of nuclear alternative splicing toadjust plant responses to varying light conditions ( Petrillo et al., 2014 ).\\nThis involves regulation of protein kinases located in the thylakoidmembrane and in the stroma that, together with thioredoxin z, control\\nthe function of the plastid polymerase complex ( Allen, 2015). While it is\\nless clear how the redox state of the photosynthetic electron transportchain in ﬂuences the expression of nuclear genes, ROS-related signals\\nare established components of chloroplast-to-nuclear signaling. Theimportance of such communication pathways may have led to furtherspecialization of certain sub-sets of chloroplasts to ful ﬁl a crucial role in\\nthe epigenetic preservation of stress memories.\\nDespite compelling evidence that ROS are pro-life signals with\\nmulti-faceted roles in plant growth and development, the concept thatoxidative damage is a major cause of light-induced loss of cellular\\nfunctions remains prominent in the photosynthesis literature. This maybe in part due to the heavy reliance on measured decreases in Fv/Fmratios as a measure of photoinhibition, without consideration that such\\nchanges may be related to sustained PSII downregulation via protective\\nsystems. Hence, caution should be exercised in the use of Fv/Fm ratios\\nto measure of photo-damage ( Foyer et al., 2017 ).\\nChloroplasts are equipped with an abundance of antioxidants that\\nclearly have overlapping functions as ROS targets. Some of these anti-\\noxidants, such as glutathione and PRX, have well characterized roles in\\nsignal transduction. While others, such as ascorbate, may simply serve\\nto attenuate the ROS signal, the complexity of the chloroplast oxidant\\nand antioxidant system a ﬀords an extensive repertoire of discrete and\\nprobably speci ﬁc redox signals that provides enormous ﬂexibility in the\\ncontrol of gene expression. This communication with the nucleus not\\nonly conveys essential information on redox pressure within the elec-\\ntron transport chain to triggers appropriate short-term genetic re-\\nsponses, but also allows strategic provision of future defenses through\\nepigenetic modi ﬁcations.\\nAcknowledgements\\nCHF thanks the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research\\nCouncil (BBSRC )UK (BB/M009130/1) for ﬁnancial support.

Such rear edge populations deserve \\nhigh priority investigation due to their unique local adaptations, important \\nconservation value and because montane pl ants may be particularly sensitive to \\nenvironmental change.  Sagina nivalis  is one of the rarest and least known arctic -\\nalpines in Britain and the vast majority of plants occur within the Ben Lawers SSSI. \\nTen permanent plots were surveyed here from 1982 -1994 by counting the number \\nof plants and tagging and measuring individuals throughout the duration of their \\nlives. The total number of plants present at each colony across the whole site was \\nalso recorded in 1996 and 2014.  Extreme fluctuations in numbers occ urred within \\nperiods of very few years and were associated with the fragile and dynamic nature \\nof the montane habitat.  Seedling mortality was very high, but age had no effect on \\nsurvival rates once plants were one year old. Most were small, only lived two years \\nand produced none or few flowers, although those that survived long enough \\ngenerally reached their maximum size and flowering potential when they were five \\nyears old. The number of plants present across the whole of Ben Lawers  halved \\nbetween 1996 and 2014, with half of all colonies extinct and a further third in \\nsignificant decline.  The greatest threats to S. nivalis  in Scotland were identified as \\nhabitat damage due to natural processes, sheep activity and climate change. A \\nreduction in snow cover may cause an interaction between these factors and \\ncompromise the long -term survival of rear edge populations of this species, other \\nrare arctic -alpines in Scotland and their associated contribution to biodiversity.  \\n \\nKey words : Snow pe arlwort ; conservation ; demography ; longevity ; threats ; climate \\nchange  \\n \\nIntroduction  \\nPopulations located at the low -latitude margins of a species’ distribution (rear edge) \\nare of important conservation value because they can be rich in genetic diversity, \\nexhibit distinct local adaptations and contain unique ecoty pes (Hampe & Petit, 2005; \\nRehm et al., 2015).  Rear edge populations therefore deserve high priority  for \\ninvestigation in order to preserve the evolutionary potential of the species and \\nmaintain bio diversity through  anticipated global change (Provan & Maggs , 2011) , yet \\nsuch ecological research is currently limited (Hampe & Petit, 2005 ).51 \\n The arctic -alpine flora of Scotland’s mountains is  of international significance  as \\nit contains many  rare species at the rear edge of their global ran ge (Sydes , 2008). \\nMontane plants may be sensitive to environmental change because they are often \\nintolerant of competition  and heavy grazing,  are specifically adapted to low \\ntemperatures  and exist in fragile and dynamic habitats  (Milne & Hartley , 2001; Björk \\n& Molau , 2007) . Populations that are small and isolated  are particularly at risk  \\n(Sydes , 2008) .   \\nThe conservation  management  of vulnerable  species  requires a considerable \\nknowledge of existing populations and the factors affecting them over the short and \\nlong-term, as well as an understanding of important aspects of their life histories \\nsuch as longevity , survival rates and fecundity. The most effective populat ion studies \\nare those that use permanently marked plots o ver decadal timescales (Geddes & \\nMiller , 2010; Ross , 2015) but the remote location of montane species usually \\npreclu des such work . Detailed life  history  information has been recorded for very few \\nof Scotland’s threatened plants (Legg et al., 1997), and empirical data on survival \\nand life span is lacking for pla nts in general (Lauenroth & Adler, 2008) , particularly \\narctic -alpines (Morris & Doak, 1998).    \\n The snow  pearlwort, Sagina nivalis  (Lindblom) Fr. , is one of Britain\\'s rarest and \\nleast known arctic -alpine  plants  (Wigginton , 1999) . It is a dwarf, tufted cushion -\\nforming perennial with tiny white flowers which open only on sunny days between \\nJuly and September , and are automatically self -pollinated (Clapham  et al., 1962) . \\nBecause of the pla nt’s inconspicuous  growth  form, it can be found only by careful \\nobservation, and often eludes even skilled botanists. Images  in Plate 1  are provided \\nat higher resolution in supplementary files Image1 – Image5 in TIFF format .  \\n The species has a  predominantly arctic  and sub-arctic  circumpolar distribution  \\nin the Northern Hemisphere  but has also been reported from the western Alps \\n(Benum , 1958; Clapham et al., 1962). The Scottish populations are at the extreme \\nsouthern margin of its north European range and are  confined to a few mountains in \\nthe Breadalbane region of the Central Highlands. This restricted British distribution \\ncurrently appears to be associated with a combination of environmental factor s: high \\naltitude, calcareous mica -schist bedrock and a low maximum temperature (Evans , \\n1982).  The vast majority of known locations  are within the Ben Lawers  Site of \\nSpecial Scientific Interest  (SSSI)  at altitudes between 915 and 1192 m. Records of S. \\nnivalis  were few prior to the 1980s  when the  species was found to be no longer \\npresent on the summit rocks on Ben Lawers (Raven & Walters , 1956), and by 1981 , \\nit had  disappeared from two of the three sites recorded in 1980 (D .K. Mardon, \\npersonal observation). Concerns were expressed for its vulnerability for local \\nextinction . Fortunately, a comprehensive survey in 1981 found enough  colonies  and \\na sufficient number  of plants to discount the possibility that the species was \\ncurrently endangered  (Payne , 1981) . However, the Ben Lawers SSSI is subject to \\nserious pressures from grazing animals and recreational use , and casual \\nobservations of the p lant’s habitat suggested that it was particularly vulnerable to \\ndisturbance.  \\n This paper describes the results of a long-term study to monitor the population \\ndynamics, turnover rate and life history  of S. nivalis with the aim of  identify ing \\npotential threats to the conservation  of this arctic -alpine at its rear edge in  Scotland . \\nSpecifically, data gathered from ten permanent plots on the Ben Lawers range \\nbetween 1982 and 1994 were used to address the following questions:  \\n1. How d id the number of plants in the plots change  during the study period  and \\nwhat factors were responsible for any fluctuations ?52 \\n 2. What is the lifespan of the species and how did this vary between the study \\nplots?  \\n3. How did plant survival vary with age ? \\n4. What was the size range of the plants and how did this vary with age?  \\n5. How w as flowering affected by  the age and size of the plants?  \\n \\nMaterials and methods  \\nPlant nomenclature follows Stace (2010).  \\n \\nStudy site  \\nThe Ben Lawers  National Nature Reserve (NNR) as currently designated is owned \\nand managed by the N ational Trust for Scotland (NTS).

Th is photo illustrates \\nthe difficulty of finding S. nivalis within its habitat. particularly when \\ngrowing amongst Minuartia sedoides .53 \\n Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI) encompasses a nine -mile stretch of nine mountains \\nincluding the 10th highest in Britain. The geology of the SSSI includes soft Dalradian \\ncalcareous mica schists which give rise to basic soils. It is arguably the most \\nimportant site in Brita in for montane plants  and has been designated  also as a \\nSpecial Area of Conservation and a National Scenic Area. In addition to S. nivalis  it \\nsupports populations of around 16 other nationally rare vascular plant  species  \\n(Wigginton , 1999) , as well as  a significant number of rare bryophytes and lichens.  \\n \\nSagina nivalis study plots  (1981 -1994)  \\nTen permanent study plots for S. nivalis were established  in 1981 across four \\nmountains within the Ben Lawers SSSI (Beinn Ghlas, Ben Lawers, An Stuc and Meall \\nGarbh) . Observations that year showed that the plant  typically grows on a surface \\nmat of bryophytes over a substrate of calcareous gravels , both on ground subject  to \\nfrequent flushing and on drier rock ledges. The sites were therefore chosen to  \\nencompass this habitat variation , at altitudes of between 970-1160 m, and on range \\nof slope angles and aspects, while also allowing field observations to be complet ed \\nin a minimum amount of time, estimated at two or three days  annually . The Ben \\nLawers  range is grazed by sheep from adjacent farms, some with heritable grazing \\nrights on the NTS land. Deer also use the area but were never observed on or near \\nthe study sites during the project or on numerous visits since.  Numbers  of sheep  \\nalso far exceed  those of  deer. P lots 1, 2 and  3 were inaccessible to sheep  grazing, \\nbut are sometimes affected by rockfalls caused  by sheep . Other species commonly \\nfound in the plots  included  Cochlearia micacea, Sagina saginoides, Salix herbacea \\nand Saxifraga oppositifolia . In the wet flushes  the moss  Blindia acuta  was almost \\ninvariably present, frequently with  the higher plant associates  Juncus triglumis, \\nSaxifraga stellaris, and often  Juncus biglumis . On the drier sites S. nivalis was \\naccompanied by Alchemilla alpina, Festuca vivipara,  Minuartia sedoides, Silene \\nacaulis, and sometimes Saxifraga nivalis.  \\n A study plot of approximately ¼  m2 was chosen because of the diminutive \\nform of the species  (described below) . This size was  roughly the extent of many \\ncolonies, was convenient for fitting onto the ledges where they occurred  and was \\nthe optimal dimensions  for producing a useful photographi c record.  The corners \\nwere marked by woode n pegs of c.20  mm square section inserted to ground level \\nand topped with a wire nail for attaching string to define the plot’s boundary. Plot \\nshape varied with the feasibility of placing \\'permanent\\' markers, and with the terrain, \\nand was roughly squ are, rectangular , trapezoidal  or triangular. Permanence could \\nnot be assured, due to the dynamic  nature of the habitats.  It was therefore \\nadvantageous to visit certain sites each spring to reposition marker peg s dislodged \\nby frost heave and note  any other evidence of disturbance during the winter.  All \\nmarkers were removed at the end of the study.  \\n The study plots were visited annually in August  or very soon after,  from 1982 -\\n1994, to record  the number of plants present. Initially, each individual was marked \\nby a temporary tag as an aid to counting.  Searching for the small and often \\ninconspicuous pear lworts was slow and time -consum ing, and plants, once spotte d, \\ncould easily b e overlooked when counting . The tags overcame this difficulty  by \\nseparating the search and find operation from the counting and recording, thus \\nenhancing the accuracy of the results.  Each tag was a \"flag\" of plastic adhesive tape \\non a 40  mm zinc -coated panel pin. Such a marker  caused negligible habitat damage \\nand was an optimal size for photographic recording. Two colours w ere used, red and \\nyellow, cut into three different shapes to distinguish six categories as follows:54 \\n  \\n1. Large flowering - longest diameter at least c.25  mm; \\n2. Medium flowering - longest diameter in the range 13 -25 mm; \\n3. Small flowering - longest diameter less than 13  mm; \\n4. Non flowering  - generally small; size not categorised;  \\n5. Seedling  - minute, usually  with only one pair of leaves (cotyledons), sometimes \\nwith a second pair, but with the potential for misidentification,  often growing in \\ndense clusters .  Assumed to be < 1 year old, germinated in th e current season.  \\nIf developed enough for confident identification, some isolated seedlings could \\nbe tagged, but an overall count was not realistic.  \\n6. Dead, dying - helped  to account for  plants tha t had died since the last visit.  \\nSome such remains were recognisable more than a year after death . \\n \\nA photographic record of the plots each year assisted  the relocation of plants \\non subsequent visits and provide d a gross visual indication of changes in the \\ndistribution of individuals  and structure of a colony, including destructive events that \\ndirectly affect ed the population. The photographs were on 35  mm colour negative \\nfilm, to facilitate printing in the days of only analogue photography.  Field notes also \\nincluded any other relevan t information, for example  signs of disturbance  such as \\nhoof prints or landslip .   \\nDuring the years  1983-1993 life history  information was also  recorded at eight \\nof the plots , as follows:  \\n \\n1. the location of each individual plant, defined by its distance from  the two \\nlowest, i.e. nearest, corner pegs, measured to the nearest 5  mm; \\n2. its overall size, measured as the product of the greatest diameter and that at \\n90°; \\n3. the number of flowers, counted with the aid of a seeker (a small metal probe, \\n1mm thick, angled and mounted on a handle, for biological use).  Any seed \\ncapsules already present were also counted as (former) flowers.    \\n \\nCollecting this amount of data  annually  from Plots 2 and 10 proved impractical \\nbecause of the large number of plants (in 1983), which took an excessive time to \\nrecord, and entailed errors  in recognising individuals. Also, the precarious position of \\nPlot 2 posed great er personal risk  than other sites. Size and flowering measurements \\nwere taken for flowering plants in Plot 10 only in 1983 and 1985.  \\n The number of flowers (or capsules) counted on the plants during a single visit \\nto the study plots was assumed to be the total produced by each individual o ver the \\ncourse of the whole season. While it is possible that some flowers were missed, this \\npossible  error was minimised by ensuring that monitoring took place once the peak \\nof flowering had occurred, which early observations suggested was in August.  \\nThe coordinates were recorded or re-recorded so that the progress of each \\nindividual could be tracked throughout the study. However, data from the first three  \\nyears showed that the  positions of plants change d from year to year, presumably \\ndue to sh ifting of the surface crust, or of the marker pegs, with frost heave.  Also, \\nthe ‘centre’ of a plant would appe ar to move by asymmetrical growth from the stock: \\nthe basal rosette is not distinguishable in mature plants.  Since 1986 therefore, to aid \\nrecognition of individual plants, they were also \\'permanently\\' tagged with coloured \\nhaberdash ery pins, although these too beca me dislodged in some cases.55 \\n Some a dult plants seemed to appear spontaneously  and presumably had be en \\noverlooked or not recorded as seedlings. The vast majority of these were small and \\nnon-flowering and so they were classed as 1-year olds.  \\nAlthough life  history  data were not collected in 1982 or 1994, it was possible to \\ngain additional information about the age  of some plants using the photographs . An \\nindividual that first appeared as a seedling or an adult in 1983 could have its lifespan \\nmeasured . Any adult plant present in an identical location in the 1982 and 1983  \\nphotographs was assu med to be th e same individual.  It was not possible to \\ndetermine age and lifespan in this case because the plant may have been alive \\nbefore the study began.  Any plant present in 1993 that disappeared from the 1994 \\nphotograph was assumed to have died . Lifespan could not  be recorded for \\nindividuals still alive in 1994.  \\n \\nFull population surveys (1996 & 2014)  \\nThe total number of plants present at each of the 37 S. nivalis  colonies found on the \\nBen Lawers range during the original 1981 survey was counted during subsequent \\nvisits in  1996 and 2014  (MacGregor, 1996; Watts, 2014) . The status of each colony \\nwas assessed  in 2014  as being either:  \\n1. Extinct; no plants found  \\n2. Declining (a loss of  ≥ 30% of plants present in 1996)  \\n3. Stable (no significant change in plant numbers since 1996 ) \\n4. Increasing (an increase of ≥ 30% of plants present in 1996)  \\n \\nData analysis  \\nWe marked 437 seedlings  with temporary tags, but many more would have been \\nmissed using the method detailed (as explained above). The seedling stage was \\ntherefore not included in the data analysis, and the results apply to plants that \\nreached at least one year of age.  A life table of survival and mortality was \\nconstructed using the calculations  described in Begon et. al.  (1996) , except that the \\nfecundity schedule ( the last two columns  of Table 2 ) relates to the number of \\nflower s produced rather than the actual number of offspring  produced . Each \\nconsecutive year of life was defined as a separate age class.   \\nThe v ariation in plant lifespan between the study plots was tested using \\nAnalysis -of-variance ( ANOVA ). Normal distribution of the original data and the \\nresiduals was confirmed using the Kolmogorov –Smirnov test and histograms.  Equal \\nvariance was determined usin g Levene’s test. A post hoc Tukey’s multiple \\ncomparison test was used to identify which plots differed significantly from each \\nother at the 95% confidence level. Variation in the diameter of the plants with age \\nwas tested using a repeated measures General Linear Model. The data w ere log \\ntransformed and combined for 8 and 9 -year old plants due to the small sample size  \\nin these categories .  \\nPlant area was calculated by multiplying the diameter (greatest distance \\nmeasured across the plants) by the width at 90º  to the longest width . The resulting \\nfigure, however, overestimates the total area , as the cushions are not rectangular \\nand the foliage can vary in density.  The relat ionship between plant area and number \\nof flowers was tested using  linear regression . This included a small number of plants \\nmeasured in Plot 10 in 1983 and 1985.  Plants still alive at the end of the study \\nexcluded from  the analyses of lifespan and maximum size. Plants already present \\nbefore the study began were only included in the analysis involving the relationship \\nbetween the number of flowers and pl ant size.56 \\n  \\nResults  \\nPopulation dynamics  \\nFig. 1 shows  the po pulation dynamics  observed in the ten study plot s. Fig. 1a gives \\nthe data for the two plots  with the highest densities of S. nivalis  (Plots 2 and 10 ), \\nwhich follow  very similar curves, the result of two diff erent causes, described below.  \\nIn Figs 1b-d plots are grouped according to some physical changes that affected  the \\nhabitat  (overgrowth of vegetation, disturbance caused by sheep or flooding) .  \\n The numbers of individuals recorded at different sites ranged from 0 to 180, \\nwith both extremes recorded on  Plot 10. All locations showed marked fluctuations, \\nsometimes doubling, trebl ing or even quadrupling, or crashing, between consecutive \\nyears  (i.e. the interval between annual visits). These p eaks and troughs did not \\ncoincide between plots;  however , the overall pattern of change was a rapid increase \\nfollowed by a slower, progressive  and serious decrease (Fig. 2).  This trend was the \\nresult of the high abundance of S. nivalis  in Plots 2 and 10 (Fig. 1a), which included \\ntwo-thirds of the plants recorded at the overall peak in 1985.  These data illustrate \\nthe difficulty that would apply to any attempt to use samples of the overall \\npopulation to measure trends. Nevertheless, most sites were in decline over the later \\nyears of the project.  \\n Table 1 summari ses the overall trends and most important events which took \\nplace at each study plot.

The plants in \\nPlots 1 and 3 had a significantly longer lifespan than those at all other sites except \\nPlot 5.

However the age specific mortality rate ( qx) was highest for \\nseedlings and lowest for plants of 3 years of age, after which there was only a slight \\nincreasing trend until the plants reached 9 years. In fact, the survivorship (Fig. 4)  \\ndisplays a classic Deevey Type II curve with constant mortality. Individuals therefore \\nexperienced a constant chance of surviving from one a ge to the next throughout \\ntheir lives once they passed the seedling stage.61 \\n \\n012345\\n1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Years\\nStudy plot \\nFigure 3 .

Although areas of up to 24.75 cm2 were recorded, 33% and \\n50% of al l plants never grew to more than 0.5 cm2 and 1 cm2 respectively. Only 3% \\never reached more than 10 cm2.62 \\n  \\nTable 2 .

One -\\nyear old plants had a mean diameter of 9.07 mm (± 1SE 0.24 , n = 422 ) which \\nincreased each year until they reached 19.47 mm (± 1SE 1.44 , n = 59) at 5 years \\nold. Plants that survived lo nger than this tended not to grow any further, and v ery \\nold plants were observed dying back  in their last year of life.  8 and 9 -year olds had a \\nmean diameter of 14.78 mm (± 1SE 2.67, n = 9).   \\n \\nFlowering  \\nOn average p lants produced a  mean  of 4 flowers throughout the  entire  duration of \\ntheir lifespan , with the most important age classes for fl owering being 2 -5 years \\n(Table 2 ). 57.5% of plants never grew any flowers at all before they died but a small \\nproportion (4.7%) did generate  at least 25 flowers  over their lifetime .  For those \\nplants which did produce flowers, the  mean age of first flowering was 2.30 years ( ± \\n1SE 0.072 , n = 197 ). If an individual lived long enough it generally produced  an \\nincreasing number of flowers each year  until it was 5 years of age, although v ery old \\nplants had fewer flowers  (see column mx, Table 2 ). There was a strong positive \\nrelationship  between flower number and plant area ( r2 = 0.71, n = 1278, p < 0.001)  \\n(Fig. 5). One individual grew as m any as 123 flowers over its entire lifespan (8 \\nyears), with 50 of these produced when it was 5 years old and had reached its \\nmaximum size of 17.5  cm2. Thus, the most fecund plants were a small number of \\nlarge, long -lived individuals , with the vast majority be ing diminutive  and developing  \\nfew or no flowers .63 \\n  \\n \\nFigure 5 . Relationship between the number of flowers produced by Sagina \\nnivalis  and plant size . \\n \\n \\nFull population surveys (1996 & 2014)  \\nIn total, 3714 plants were counted across Ben Lawers  in 1996 but only 1848 in \\n2014, which represents a decline of 50.24% after 18 years. Of the 37 individual \\ncolonies which were surveyed, 19 (51.3%) were extinct, 12 (32.4%) had declined \\nsignificantly, two (5.4%) were stable and only four (10.8%) had increased.  \\n \\nDiscussion  \\nLong-term monitoring of individuals of Sagina nivalis  within fixed plots on Ben \\nLawers has revealed dramatic fluctuations in the numbers over 1 4 years . Most of \\nthese fluctuations were associated with the physical instability of the habitat  in which \\nS. nivalis  occurs , indicating that the population dynamics of the species are strongly \\ninfluenced by the fragile nature of its montane environment  which is highly \\nsusceptible to disturbance caused by rockfalls, trampling and flooding . Individuals in \\nPlots 1 and 3 had significantly longer lifespans than those in the other study plots  (P \\n< 0.001 ), and with the exception a landslip event in Plot 1 early in the study, these \\nsites were subject to fewer observable changes  (as was Plot 5).  Habitat dynamism \\nfor S. nivalis  is chiefly derived from natural, ongoing erosion of cliffs and steep \\nslopes, combined with frost heave, rockfalls, and in some places, occasional \\ninundation with water.  When accelerated (sometimes by sheep ) these \\ngeomorpholo gical events can catastrophically reduce populations or even cause \\nthem to disappear entirely.   \\n However, su ch processes maintain  suitably open habitat for S. nivalis  by \\npreventing encroachment by more competitive grasses, sedges, herbs and mosses . \\nIf left undisturbed t he plots tended  to become overgrown with vegetatio n towards \\nthe end of the study which also  coincided with population declines.  In fact, alpine \\nsnow bed plants are sensitive to competition  because a denser canopy reduces light \\navailabilit y (Austrheim & Eriksson , 2001) and belowground competition may be \\nparticularly severe in nutrient -poor high mountain pioneer soils ( Dullinger & Hülber , y = 1.67x - 0.85 \\nR² = 0.71  \\n0102030405060\\n0 5 10 15 20 25No. flowers  \\nArea (cm2)64 \\n 2011), although this may not be so relevant at Ben Lawers.  In addition, \\nenvironmental disturbances can be important for creating the conditions favourable \\nfor arctic -alpine seedling establishment (Chambers , 1995).   \\n Alternatively , the longer lifespan of the plants in Plots 1 and 3 could  be related \\nto their lower population  densities , which would have reduc ed the level of \\ncompetition between S. nivalis plants. Both sites also  included areas of bare rock, \\nparticularly Plot 3, which would have provided fewer niches for colonisation by S. \\nnivalis or indeed other competitive species, hence the lower levels of vegetation \\nencroachment at these locations . \\n The life history of the species also reflects its dynamic and unstable habitat.  \\nThe majority of plants were extremely short -lived, diminutive and de veloped few or \\nno flowers. Plants with short lifespans often occur in open, disturbed areas (García \\net al., 2007).  This study also found that individuals experienced a constant chance of \\nsurviving from one age to the next throughout their lives once they passed the \\nseedling stage. A Type-II survivorship curve could be a characteristic of alpine \\nperennials because the e xtreme abiotic stresses they are subjected to maintain \\nconsistent mortality rates during all stages of their life span.  Local environmental \\nconditions can exert an important influence on the shape of a survivorship curve \\n(Aziz & Khan, 1993) . However, the cushion -forming Silene  acaulis , which can grow \\nalongside S. nivalis , instead follows a characteristic Type-III survivorship curve and \\nis much longer lived (Morris & Doak, 1998). But it has extremely high mortality rates \\nin the early years of life, as does S. nivalis  during the seedling stage.   \\nHigh mortality of seedlings is an important component of the selection \\noperating in  plant life cycles (Silvertown & Dickie, 1980) and is not uncommon in \\narctic -alpine environments (Chambers , 1995; Forbis , 2003). For S. nivalis this may \\nbe because the seeds germinate where they drop, usually close to mature plants. \\nThis creates clusters of seedlings so dense that few plants could ever grow to \\nmaturity.  The reproductive ecology of many arctic alpines, in terms of dispersal \\ndistances, vegetative spread or regeneration, seed longevity or the existence of any \\nseed bank in the soil , is poorly known . A highly restricted seed dispersal capacity has \\nbeen recorded for other snowbed species and passively dispersed alpine pl ants \\n(Scherff et al., 1994).  Evidence of short -range seed dispersal of S. nivalis by gravity \\nwas provided by the regeneration of the entire colony in study Plot 4 after it was \\nwiped out by a landslip in 1983. Thus, it is conceivable that the minute seeds o f S. \\nnivalis  are dispersed by wind or carried downhill by the flow of surface water and \\nsnowmelt. It is also possible that entire individuals or plant fragments that have \\nbeen uprooted could take root elsewhere, which may explain the occasional \\nappearance of some new adult plants within the plots.  \\nThis study found correlations between plant age, size, and the number of \\nflowers in S. nivalis , with  such relationships documented across a range of plant \\nspecies (Silvertown , 1985; Waller , 1988; Weiner , 1988; Ollerton & Lack, 1998; Pires \\net al., 2014). In fact, the neighbouring Silene acaulis also increased in cushion \\ndiameter with age (Morris & Doak, 1998). Plant size is usually considered a \\npredominantly environmentally influenced characteristic, determined b y plant age \\nand growing conditions (Waller , 1988; Ollerton & Lack, 1998).  Flowering \\nperformance was the only reproductive attribute that could be recorded in our field \\nstudy. Unidentified and unmeasured variables may be affecting other attributes, e.g. \\npollination rates, seed production, fertility and germination.65 \\n  \\nImplications for c onservation  \\nThis study has indicated that a small proportion of individuals with in populations of \\nSagina nivalis  have considerably greater longevity and fecundity than  the vast \\nmajority. These long -lived individuals may impart some long -term stability to the \\npopulations. It appears that maximum size and reproductive capacity is achieved by \\nplants that live to 5 years of age. Therefore, populations may be at risk from \\ninstabilities and changes in the habitat that prevent at least some plants from \\nreaching this age. Such threats recognised from this study and other, ongoing \\nobservations at Ben Lawers include natural and anthropogenic factors, which are not \\nnecessarily unrel ated: \\n1. Habitat damage from natural, dynamic processes  \\n2. Impact of human recreational activities  \\n3. Direct impact of sheep   \\n4. Climate change  \\nGeomorphological processes have already been discussed above. Erosion and \\ndisturbance by hillwalking can significantly dama ge montane habitats (Bayfield , \\n1979; Bayfield et al., 1981; Thompson  et al., 1987), particularly at popular hills such \\nas Ben Lawers.  Here the main walking routes at present do not coincide with S. \\nnivalis  habitat, and so human activity is unlikely to pose  a significant threat to the \\noverall population. Localised trampling by botanically interested visitors has been \\nobserved where the habitat is shared with several other rare or scarce species.  \\nHowever, s heep trampling  destroyed plants and caused a signific ant decline in \\nthe populations of S. nivalis  at Plots 9 and 10. Its potential as  a threat is also \\nsuggested  by the fact that the plots with the longest mean plant lifespan, 1 and 3, \\nwere the only inaccessible locations (as well as Plot 2, which was not included in the \\nlifespan analysis).  It is doubtful that S. nivalis  is selectively grazed due to its low \\nprofile and any effects of dung and urine are not known. Grazing may provide some \\nbenefit fo r arctic -alpines by suppressing competing  species and facili tating \\nrecruitment through small -scale disturbances (Austrheim & Eriksson , 2001), although \\nthis has not yet been observed for S. nivalis . Nevertheless, it is generally thought \\nthat a reduction in sheep grazing in montane Britain will promote the conservati on of \\nsome summit communities ( Thompson  et al., 1987; Thompson & Brown , 1992). At \\nBen Lawers this is dependent upon the NTS acquiring heritable grazing rights \\ncurrently owned by several independent farmers.  \\n The overall pattern of population change throughout this study was a rapid \\nincrease in numbers of S. nivalis followed by a slower, progressive and serious \\ndecline since 1985.  Furthermore, the number of plants present across the whole of \\nBen Lawers SSSI has  halved between 1996 and 2014, with half of all colonies now \\nextinct and a further third in significant decline  (Watts, 2014) . These trends, along \\nwith the  association with snow  that is  implicit in the species name, suggest that \\nclimate change could be having  a serious impact on S. nivalis in Scotland.  There has \\nbeen a declining trend in the number of days of snow cover at Ben Lawers between \\n1979 and 2003, particularly, at 900m (Trivedi et. al. , 2007). This has been obvious \\nsince the beginning of the 1990s, in contrast to the initial years of the study when \\nthe plots became buried by early, autumnal snowfalls  which provided months -long \\ncontinuity of cover  (D.K. Mardon, personal observation ). \\n The snow cover at 1060m is projected to be reduced by 21% by the 2050s \\nunder a low greenhouse gas emissions scenario and by 32% under a high emissions \\nscenario (Trivedi et. al. , 2007). Climate change  has already caused biotic66 \\n homogenization of the Scottish uplands through an increase in generalists, such as \\ngraminoids, and a decline in specialist arctic -montane species (Ross et. al. , 2012). \\nSnow is probably critically important for S. nivalis because it protects alpine habitats  \\nfrom erosive processes such as freeze -thaw cycles and suppresses compet ing \\nspecies by shortening the growing season (Belsky & Moral , 1980; Björk & Molau , \\n2007). This may be one reason why  vegetation encroachment occurred in 9 out of \\n10 plots towards the e nd of the study.  A reduction in snow duration will also allow \\ngreater access by sheep , thereby  increasing grazing impacts (Austrheim & Eriksson , \\n2001) and accelerating  slippage and rockfalls through hoof action on soils made \\nunstable by frost heave  (D.K. Mardon, personal observation ). An interaction between \\nthreats 1, 3 and 4 is therefore likely (Trivedi et. al. , 2008).  As a result, S. nivalis  may \\nbe one of the most vulnerable of all British vascular plants to climate change . \\nConsequently, the rear edge population of this species and its associated biodiversity \\nvalue and evolutionary potential is at risk . The results of this study also have \\nimplications for populations of other rare Scottish arctic -alpines residing in similar  \\nhabitats, for example Minuartia rubella and Saxifraga cernua , as it is likely that they \\nwill likewise  be subjected to the threats imposed on S. nivalis . \\n Monitoring is essential for detecting trends in montane communities and for \\ndeveloping conservation policies, particularly in the face of climate change (Trivedi \\net. al. , 2008). The documentation of the distribution and abundance of the rare plant \\nspecies at Ben Lawers has been mostly carried out by employees of the NTS, the \\nowner  of the NNR as currently designated. It is unlikely that landowners other than \\nconservation bodies would undertake the time -consuming, detailed observations \\nneeded to understand and conserve such species.  Of the 1,848 S. nivalis  plants \\nrecorded  in 2014, 78 % were on NTS land . Therefore, the Trust has a unique \\nresponsibility for the future of the species in Scotland. We believe that the ability to \\nenhance and promote understanding of it, as well as others in a similar but less \\nextreme situation, will depend o n the long -term continuity of resident staff with an \\necological bias at Ben Lawers.  \\n \\nEnvironmental and Experimental Botany 71 (2011) 10–17\\nContents lists available at ScienceDirect\\nEnvironmental and Experimental Botany\\njournal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/envexpbot\\nLeaf paraheliotropism in Styrax camporum confers increased light use efﬁciency\\nand advantageous photosynthetic responses rather than photoprotection\\nGustavo Habermanna,∗, Patricia F.V.

Introduction\\nTrees and shrubs growing in the cerrado, or the Brazilian\\nsavanna, which is characterized by wet (October–March) and\\ndry (April–September) seasons, have to adjust their morpho-\\nphysiological traits seasonally to successfully cope with the soil\\nwater availability. The cerrado vegetation is a vertically structured\\nmosaic of grassland, scrubland, and dense woodland physiog-\\nnomies (Haridasan, 2008). The soils of these areas are deep, acidic,\\nsandy, contain low levels of organic matter and phosphorus, and\\nare rich in aluminum (Haridasan, 2008).\\n∗Corresponding author.

Habermann).\\n1CNPq fellowship.Concomitant to seasonal water deﬁcit, the cerrado environment\\nexperiences a high irradiance load and elevated vapor pressure\\ndeﬁcits (VPD). Under such conditions, paraheliotropic leaf move-\\nment is one of the strategies used by many plants. Diaheliotropic\\nleaves, which are oriented at an angle perpendicular to incom-\\ning light, maximize light interception, while paraheliotropic leaves,\\nwhich orient parallel to the light, minimize it (Koller, 1986, 1990;\\nBielenberg et al., 2003; Pastenes et al., 2005; Arena et al., 2008 ).\\nIn leguminous species, paraheliotropic leaf movements are\\nrapidly induced by unfavorable conditions. In beans, leaf para-\\nheliotropism is induced by water deﬁcit (Pastenes et al., 2005),\\nleaf heat and excess sunlight interception (Bielenberg et al., 2003).\\nIn the soybean, leaf paraheliotropism is induced with increasing\\nirradiance (Jiang et al., 2006). For leguminous cerrado species,\\nparaheliotropism may be a strategy to avoid excess sunlight inter-\\nception at noon (Caldas et al., 1997; Rodrigues and Machado, 2006),\\n0098-8472/© 2010 Elsevier B.V. Open access under the Elsevier OA license.\\ndoi:10.1016/j.envexpbot.2010.10.012G. Habermann et al. / Environmental and Experimental Botany 71 (2011) 10–17 11\\nwhich reinforces the photo-protective role of paraheliotropism.\\nEven the leaf wilting movement of non-leguminous species, suchas cotton plants, confers photo-protection and maintains carbonassimilation ( Zhang et al., 2010 ).\\nAnother leguminous species, Robinia pseudoacacia exhibits\\nparaheliotropic leaf movement at high irradiance levels ( Liu et al.,\\n2007 ), reducing light interception and leaf temperature ( Arena\\net al., 2008 ). However, paraheliotropic leaves of R. pseudoacacia\\nshow higher stomatal conductance ( gs) and CO\\n2assimilation rates\\n(A), which are attributed to a higher photochemical performance of\\nunrestrained paraheliotropic leaves, compared to restrained leaves(Arena et al., 2008 ).\\nHowever, the physiological role of paraheliotropism may not\\nbe universal. Styrax camporum , a non-leguminous species from the\\ncerrado, possesses leaves that are always diaheliotropic as well asother leaves that assume a paraheliotropic position from 10:00 hto 17:00 h ( Habermann et al., 2008 ). Paraheliotropic leaves of this\\nspecies have higher Aand transpiration rates ( E) compared to the\\ndiaheliotropic leaves, although this high Ehas a weak relationship\\nwith the reduction in leaf temperature ( Habermann et al., 2008 ).\\nThis study also demonstrated compact spongy parenchyma in bothleaf types, and a rise in Awith the increase of irradiance for parahe-\\nliotropic leaves. Thus, this species might exploit the paraheliotropicleaf movement to enhance light use efﬁciency.\\nIn the present study, we hypothesized that, compared to diahe-\\nliotropic leaves, the paraheliotropic leaves of S. camporum would\\nshow higher values of gas exchange rates if measured with lightintercepted by adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces. Measurements ofgas exchange with devices that enabled artiﬁcial light intercep-tion only by adaxial or abaxial leaf surfaces (LI-6400 Irga with a6400-02B red/blue LED light source) and with devices that enabledsunlight interception by both leaf sides (LI-6200 Irga with a trans-parent 6000-12 one liter chamber) were performed in April 2006,in Botucatu-SP and Corumbataí-SP, Brazil. The leaf water potential,the leaf temperature of para- and diaheliotropic leaves, and the rel-ative reﬂected light intensity of adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces ofS.camporum were also measured. Anatomical and ultra-structural\\nleaf analyses were performed as a framework for the functionalstudies (see online supplementary information, Fig. S1 ).\\n2. Materials and methods\\n2.1. Site description\\nThis study was conducted using adult plants of S. camporum\\nPohl. from cerrado fragments characterized by scattered trees andshrubs and a large proportion of grassland (“closed ﬁeld”) in themunicipalities of Botucatu, São Paulo (SP) state, Brazil (22\\n◦51/primeS,\\n48◦26/primeW) and Corumbataí, SP state, Brazil (22◦13/primeS, 47◦37/primeW).\\nFive individual plants between 1.5 and 2-m tall from each of\\nthese sites were used. Plants were completely leafy at the begin-ning of the fall season in April 2006, when the measurements wereobtained.\\n2.2. Leaf angle measurement\\nIn order to classify leaves as para- or diaheliotropic, the petiole\\nangle formed with the horizon was measured. A ﬁne wire was posi-tioned between the petiole and a ruler with a water level, whichrepresented the horizon. The curvature radius formed by the wiremirrored the petiole angle. Then, the angle deﬁned by the wire wasreproduced on paper and determined with a goniometer, similar tothe method presented by Arena et al. (2008) .\\nLeaves showing petiole angle greater than 50\\n◦were classiﬁed as\\nparaheliotropic leaves, which were marked on each plant at noonon the day before the measurements were performed. Leaves dis-\\nplaying a petiole angle between 0◦and 10◦were considered as\\ndiaheliotropic. Both leaf types occurred on woody stems, and hadmature fully expanded leaf blades. Very young and very old leaveswere avoided.\\n2.3. Leaf gas exchange measurements\\nGas exchange was measured using an infrared gas analyzer (LI-\\n6200, LI-Cor, USA) with a 6000-12 one liter chamber, which is madeof Lexan\\n®and MargardTMtransparent materials. These materials\\nhave a transmittance of 90% in the visible and near infra-red spectra,but bellow 450 nm it falls markedly to 60% at 400 nm ( Li-Cor, 1990 ).\\nTherefore, this leaf cuvette enables sunlight absorptance from 300to 1100 nm ( Li-Cor, 1990 ). This leaf cuvette has inserts which were\\nused to ﬁx leaf area to 6 cm\\n2(a predetermined size), allowing faster\\nmeasurements and exposure of adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces todirect sunlight or diffuse irradiance (soil reﬂection and scatteredirradiance). Additionally, gas exchange was also measured with aninfra-red gas analyzer (LI-6400, Li-Cor, USA) using a leaf cuvettethat enables artiﬁcial red and blue LED light (6400-02B, Li-Cor, USA)interception by only one of the leaf surfaces. The 6400-02B red bluelight source spectral output has one peak centered at about 670 nmand a secondary peak at about 465 nm ( Li-Cor, 2004 ).\\nBecause paraheliotropic leaves were not ﬂat on both sides of the\\nmidrib, and showed different inclination planes, it was not possibleto measure just one of the leaf sides of the midrib without disturb-ing the leaf planes. Otherwise, it would not match the minimumarea necessary to make measurements in gas exchange chambers.Thus, the leaf planes of paraheliotropic leaves became entirely ﬂatwhen leaf cuvettes of both equipments were closed. However, thepetiole angle was not disturbed. Diaheliotropic leaves were nat-urally completely ﬂat, following the petiole angle, which was notdisturbed as well.\\nCO\\n2assimilation ( A) and transpiration ( E) rates, stomatal con-\\nductance ( gs), and intercellular CO 2(Ci) were determined by the\\nIrgas’ data analysis programs, which employ the Von Caemmerer\\nand Farquhar (1981) general gas exchange equations for both\\nequipments. The photosynthetic radiation use efﬁciency (PhRUE),was also calculated (See online supplementary data for moredetails about the method for calculating PhRUE, Table S1 ). Both\\nleaf cuvettes had external quantum sensors, which were used tomeasure the incoming sunlight. In the case of the leaf cuvette thatenabled light interception by both leaf sides, the quantum sensormeasured ambient PPFD intercepted by leaves. The leaf cuvette thatenabled artiﬁcial light interception by only one of the leaf sides wasset to provide 1800 /H9262mol photons m\\n−2s−1, as ambient PPFD varied\\nfrom 1000 to 1600 /H9262mol photons m−2s−1. The leaf temperature ( Tl)\\nwas obtained using a small thermocouple within the leaf cuvettesof both systems, according to Bielenberg et al. (2003) .\\nCurves of A,gs, and Cias a function of the PPFD values estab-\\nlished in the leaf cuvette that enables artiﬁcial light interceptionby only one of the leaf sides were also constructed to detect thesole responses of the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces of para- anddiaheliotropic leaves. These curves were generated at a controlledleaf temperature (25 ±1\\n◦C).\\n2.4. Estimation of leaf reﬂectance\\nAn estimation of the relative intensity of reﬂected light from\\nboth leaf sides was performed using a ﬂuorometer (Cary Eclipse,Varian, USA), which detects scattered light reﬂected within thesame spectrum ( /NAK) of incident light. Five young one-year-old S.\\ncamporum potted plants were maintained under natural sunlight.\\nAs no previous differences were detected from the same leaf surfacebetween para- or diaheliotropic leaves, one randomly selected leaf12 G. Habermann et al. / Environmental and Experimental Botany 71 (2011) 10–17\\nfrom each of the ﬁve plants was detached and immediately inserted\\ninto the equipment. The angle between the leaf and light beam wasclose (but not exactly) to 45\\n◦, so that reﬂected light intensity could\\nnot saturate the detector.\\n2.5. Leaf water potential\\nThe leaf water potential at predawn ( /TABpd) and midday (when\\nthe vapor pressure deﬁcit, VPD, was maximum) ( /TABmd) were mea-\\nsured by the pressure chamber method ( Turner, 1981 ) using a\\nDIK-7000 (Daiki Kogyo, Japan) pressure chamber.\\n2.6. Data analysis\\nStatistical analysis was carried out using two leaves randomly\\nselected from ﬁve plants (replicates) within an area of ﬁve hectares(ha) in Botucatu and 37 ha in Corumbataí. Gas exchange variables(A,E,gs, and Ci),T\\nl,/TABpd, and /TABmdwere determined (mean and stan-\\ndard deviation), and they were then subjected to one-way analysisof variance (comparisons between para- and diaheliotropic leaves),followed by the Tukey’s test ( P< 0.05).\\n2.7. Light and electron microscopy\\nSee online supplementary data for more details about the meth-\\nods used for obtaining and analyzing light and electron microscopicimages ( Fig. S1 ).\\n3. Results\\n3.1. Morpho-anatomical traits\\nLeaves of S. camporum are almost all diaheliotropic, but some\\nmature fully expanded leaves assume paraheliotropic positionfrom 10:00 h to 17:00 h. These mature completely expanded para-and diaheliotropic leaves are observed on woody stems, and alsoon primary branches of adult plants ( Fig. S1a ).\\nYoung leaves of S. camporum presented the trichome indumen-\\ntum on both surfaces of the leaf blade ( Fig. S1b ), while mature fully\\nexpanded leaves displayed a glabrous adaxial surface, regardless ofits heliotropic position ( Fig. S1d ).\\nThe mesophyll of both young ( Fig. S1c ) and mature\\n(Figs. S1d and e ) leaves was differentiated into a unistratiﬁed\\npalisade and a two- to three-layered spongy chlorenchyma.Spongy parenchyma cells showed numerous wall ingrowths(Figs. S1d and e ), which developed into slit-like gas spaces. Such\\ncells presented thin walls and a peripheral cytoplasm with numer-ous chloroplasts ( Fig. S1e ) and a single central vacuole that could\\nbe translucent or dense if ﬁlled with phenolic substances. Seeonline supplementary data ( Fig. S1 ) for details.\\n3.2. Gas exchange variables\\nWhen the leaves were measured with light interception by both\\nleaf sides, the CO\\n2assimilation rate ( A) was signiﬁcantly higher for\\npara- than for diaheliotropic leaves at 9:00 h, 11:00 h, and 14:00 h,but Awas similar between leaf types at the end of the day ( Fig. 1 a).\\nThe stomatal conductance ( gs) and transpiration rates ( E) followed\\nalmost the same response pattern ( Fig. 1 c and e), with parahe-\\nliotropic leaves demonstrating higher values than diaheliotropicleaves during most parts of the day. Paraheliotropic leaves exhib-ited a signiﬁcant lower value of internal CO\\n2(Ci) compared to\\ndiaheliotropic leaves, but only at 9:00 h ( Fig. 1 g).\\nLeaves measured with light interception by only the adaxial leaf\\nsurface demonstrated similar Avalues for para- and diaheliotropic\\nleaves throughout the day, except at 11:00 h, when paraheliotropicleaves exhibited a higher Acompared to diaheliotropic leaves\\n(Fig. 1 b). For gsand E, differences were detected only at 9:00 h\\nand 14:00 h, respectively ( Fig. 1 d and f). Internal CO 2concentra-\\ntions were similar in para- and diaheliotropic leaves, with the lattershowing greater values at 14:00 h, although this increase was notsigniﬁcantly higher than the CO\\n2concentrations in paraheliotropic\\nleaves ( Fig. 1 h).\\nVariations in gsdid not seem to inﬂuence the Aof leaves mea-\\nsured with sunlight interception by both leaf sides; daily resultsrevealed a conserved low gsrange with respective low carbon\\nassimilation rates for diaheliotropic leaves, while most of the datafor paraheliotropic leaves demonstrated a higher gsrange with\\nrespective higher CO\\n2assimilation rates ( Fig. 2 a). In contrast, when\\nleaves were measured with light interception by only the adax-ial leaf surface, increases in gsresulted in greater CO\\n2assimilation\\nrates, regardless of the leaf type ( Fig. 2 b).\\nThe Civalues of leaves measured with sunlight interception by\\nboth leaf sides were not dependent on gs(Fig. 3 a). However, when\\nleaves were measured with light interception by only the adaxialleaf surface, Ciﬂuctuated between 200 and 300 /H9262mol mol\\n−1, and\\nthis effect was dependent on gs(Fig. 3 b).\\nSimilarly, Awas not inﬂuenced by Ciin either paraheliotropic or\\ndiaheliotropic leaves intercepting light by both leaf sides ( Fig. 4 a);\\nbut when measuring gas exchange with light interception by onlythe adaxial leaf side, increases in Ciresulted in greater carbon\\nassimilation rates, regardless of the leaf type ( Fig. 4 b).\\nBoth surfaces of para- and diaheliotropic leaves displayed a sim-\\nilar ( P< 0.05) Afrom 0 to 100 PPFD; but from 200 to 1800 /H9262mol\\nphotons m\\n−2s−1, diaheliotropic leaves showed signiﬁcantly higher\\n(P< 0.05) Afor the adaxial than for the abaxial side ( Fig. 5 a). The\\nadaxial surface, compared to the abaxial surface of paraheliotropicleaves, showed a higher ( P< 0.05) Awithin the range of 200 and\\n800/H9262mol photons m\\n−2s−1; however, from 1000 to 1800 PPFD,\\nadaxial and abaxial sides of the paraheliotropic leaves exhibited asimilar ( P< 0.05) A(Fig. 5 a). Regarding the gs/PPFD curves, adaxial\\nand abaxial sides of both leaf types presented similar ( P< 0.05) val-\\nues at each PPFD ( Fig. 5 b). For Ci, the abaxial side presented greater\\nvalues than the adaxial side for only diaheliotropic leaves, consid-ering a range between 200 and 800 /H9262mol photons m\\n−2s−1; from\\n1000 to 1800 PPFD, both surfaces of the two leaf types had similar(P< 0.05) Civalues ( Fig. 5 c).\\nThe photosynthetic radiation use efﬁciency (PhRUE) was higher\\nin paraheliotropic than in diaheliotropic leaves at every time of dayconsidered, when the leaves were measured with sunlight inter-ception by both leaf sides. However, when leaves were artiﬁciallyilluminated only on the adaxial leaf surface, PhRUE was the samebetween para- and diaheliotropic leaves, except at 11:00 h, whenparaheliotropic leaves presented increased PhRUE in relation todiaheliotropic leaves. See online supplementary data ( Table S1 ) for\\ndetails.\\n3.3. Leaf temperature\\nThe leaf temperature remained between 30\\n◦C and 38◦C for\\nleaves measured when light intercepted both leaf sides, and para-heliotropic leaves demonstrated lower values than diaheliotropicleaves only at 11:00 h and 16:00 h ( Fig. 6 a). When leaves were mea-\\nsured with light interception by only the adaxial leaf side, the leaftemperature ﬂuctuated between 25\\n◦C and 32◦C, although no sig-\\nniﬁcant differences between leaf types were detected throughoutthe day ( Fig. 6 b).\\n3.4.

The relative light intensity reﬂected from the abaxialleaf surface was signiﬁcantly higher than light reﬂected from theadaxial leaf surface within the visible light (400–700 nm). How-ever, considering wavelengths of 200–400 nm and 700–800 nm,reﬂectance was similar between both leaf surfaces ( Fig. 8 ).4. Discussion\\n4.1.

For both leaf types, the\\nincreased stomatal aperture did not result in enhanced intercellu-lar CO\\n2(Fig. 3 a), the variation of which clearly did not affect the\\ncarbon assimilation rates ( Fig. 4 a). Furthermore, in nature, sunlight\\ninterception by the abaxial leaf side certainly does not explain thegreater gsfound in para- compared to diaheliotropic leaves ( Fig. 1 c),\\nbecause adaxial and abaxial sides of both leaf types when illumi-nated by the artiﬁcial red/blue light demonstrated the same valuesofgsat each PPFD of the gs/PPFD curves ( Fig. 5 b).\\nLeaves measured with light interception by only the adaxial\\nleaf surface showed signiﬁcantly higher Ain para- than in diahe-\\nliotropic leaves only at 11:00 h ( Fig. 1 b).

For Helianthus annus leaves, direct light reﬂectance was only\\nslightly higher in the abaxial compared to the adaxial leaf surface,but diffuse light reﬂectance was signiﬁcantly higher in the abax-ial compared to the adaxial side ( Gorton et al., 2010 ). The stellate\\npubescence, which covers the abaxial leaf surface and is absent onthe adaxial side of S. camporum leaves ( Habermann et al., 2008 )\\nis, then, responsible for this increased light reﬂectance. In fact, theeffective quantum yield of photosystem II ( /Phi1PSII) and the electron\\ntransport rate (ETR) for both leaf sides of one-year-old S. campo-\\nrum plants were similar between leaf types, but higher in adaxial\\ncompared to abaxial sides (data not shown).\\nHowever, when carbon assimilation was measured with light\\ninterception by only one of the leaf sides using the artiﬁcialred/blue light, which precisely emits the photosynthetic activewaveband, it seems that the vertical leaf position of S. campo-\\nrum enables increased light use efﬁciency. When PPFD varied from\\n200 to 1800 /H9262mol photons m\\n−2s−1, the adaxial sides of diahe-\\nliotropic leaves displayed maximum CO 2assimilation rates ( Amax\\nunder saturating light, but non-saturating CO 2, for photosynthesis\\nresponses) that were signiﬁcantly higher than those of their abaxialsides ( Fig. 5 a).

These results sup-\\nport the integration of the photosynthetic capacities of adaxial andabaxial leaf sides, which may have occurred in S. camporum (Fig. 1 a).\\nWe have not measured the apparent quantum yield, but when\\nleaves were illuminated on both surfaces, the photosynthetic radi-ation use efﬁciency (PhRUE) was higher in para- compared todiaheliotropic leaves throughout the day, and when the samerange of PPFD intercepted adaxial leaf surfaces only, para- and dia-heliotropic leaves showed similar PhRUE at 9:00 h, 14:00 h, and16:00 h (See online supplementary data for details; Table S1 ). Thus,\\nwe propose that the leaves of S. camporum photosynthetically ben-\\neﬁt from paraheliotropism, although there is no evidence that thisgreat PhRUE increases plant ecological performance, for instance,by increasing plant biomass.\\nThe vertical leaf position in S. camporum enables increased pho-\\ntosynthetic efﬁciency in terms of CO\\n2consumption, but not in\\nterms of light absorptance, especially when considering the contri-bution of the abaxial leaf surface, which is highly reﬂective. In fact,for some epiphytic fern leaves, the higher Avalues observed for\\nthe leaf side mostly exposed to direct sunlight was attributable toa greater CO\\n2consumption ( Martin et al., 2009 ). Notwithstanding,\\nthe reﬂectance pattern of the adaxial side is very similar to the abax-ial leaf side, with both sides exhibiting great reﬂectance within thegreen spectrum (525–575 nm) ( Fig. 8 ). This indicates that, although\\npubescence promotes light reﬂectance, the abaxial leaf surface cer-tainly absorbs a small amount of light within the red spectrum,which is greater in direct sunlight than in scattered light. For H.\\nannus leaves, there was almost the same direct light absorptance\\nbetween the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces, but when diffuselight absorptance was measured, the abaxial side showed a slightlylower value ( Gorton et al., 2010 ). Therefore, as supported by A/PPFD\\ncurves ( Fig. 5 a) abaxial leaf surfaces of S. camporum may not have\\nlight leaf absorptance signiﬁcantly decreased under elevated irra-diances. S. camporum leaves have compact spongy parenchyma and\\nampliﬁed palisade parenchyma (See online supplementary datafor details; Figs. S1d, e and f ), suggesting that these cells have\\nhigh chlorophyll content. Features such as stomata limited to theabaxial surface, developed palisade parenchyma, and compactlyarranged spongy parenchyma are constant in leaves of cerradowoody species ( Bieras and Sajo, 2009 ). Indeed, compact leaf tissues\\nhave previously been suggested to enable greater light interceptionand high water use efﬁciency ( Chaves et al., 2002 ).G. Habermann et al. / Environmental and Experimental Botany 71 (2011) 10–17 17\\nOne could still argue that different devices, rather than light\\ninterception, determined the differences in gas exchange, since nat-ural sunlight was used for double sided illumination measurementsand artiﬁcial red/blue light was used for single sided illuminationmeasurements. However, regardless of the device/system used,the range of PPFD values reaching leaf surfaces was very similar.Moreover, results of A,gs, and Ciobtained from PPFD curves indi-\\ncated that there are distinct responses in para- and diaheliotropicleaves when considering each leaf surface under saturating andnon-saturating red/blue light ( Fig. 5 ).\\nFinally, it is essential to emphasize that it was not the leaf age,\\nrather than the leaf position, that determined our observations.Paraheliotropic leaves that were assessed were distinguishablefrom diaheliotropic leaves. These paraheliotropic leaves hadmature fully expanded blades, and they were localized on woodystems and primary branches of adult plants. Additionally, for somestems, paraheliotropic and diaheliotropic leaves were adjacent toeach other (See online supplementary data for details; Fig. S1a ).\\n4.4. Ecophysiological signiﬁcance of heliotropism for S.\\ncamporum\\nIt has been accepted that paraheliotropism is a mechanism\\nfor reducing transpiration rates, irradiance interception, conse-quently minimizing leaf heat and the potential for photoinhibition(Ehleringer and Forseth, 1980; Forseth and Ehleringer, 1982;\\nForseth and Teramura, 1986; Bielenberg et al., 2003; Pastenes et al.,2005; Liu et al., 2007; Arena et al., 2008 ), although paraheliotropism\\nmay also prevent optimum CO\\n2assimilation rates ( Pastenes et al.,\\n2005 ). These traditional explanations for the signiﬁcance of leaf\\nheliotropism have been based on leguminous species, including P.\\npubescens from the cerrado ( Caldas et al., 1997 ).\\nNonetheless, our data strongly suggest that, although the abax-\\nial leaf surface is highly reﬂective, it may absorb a small amountof natural direct light within the red spectrum, which photosyn-thetically increases the efﬁciency of paraheliotropic leaves in termsof CO\\n2consumption, because adaxial and abaxial leaf sides seem\\nto integrate their respective carbon assimilation rates. However,these observations are detected only if measured with devices thatenable light interception by both leaf surfaces. Moreover, parahe-liotropism in S. camporum does not seem to be related to leaf heat\\navoidance ( Fig. 6 ), neither does it minimize the potential for pho-\\ntoinhibition (data not shown). Therefore, in contrast to the resultsfor leguminous species, the paraheliotropism of only some leavesofS. camporum , which do not even show pulvinus in their petioles\\n(Machado, 1991 ), could have novel signiﬁcance for plant ecophys-\\niology.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank Dr. Luis Alberti for Photoshop assistance; Fundac ¸ã o\\nde Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (Fapesp) for fel-lowships to Patricia F.

Such rear edge populations deserve \\nhigh priority investigation due to their unique local adaptations, important \\nconservation value and because montane pl ants may be particularly sensitive to \\nenvironmental change.  Sagina nivalis  is one of the rarest and least known arctic -\\nalpines in Britain and the vast majority of plants occur within the Ben Lawers SSSI. \\nTen permanent plots were surveyed here from 1982 -1994 by counting the number \\nof plants and tagging and measuring individuals throughout the duration of their \\nlives. The total number of plants present at each colony across the whole site was \\nalso recorded in 1996 and 2014.  Extreme fluctuations in numbers occ urred within \\nperiods of very few years and were associated with the fragile and dynamic nature \\nof the montane habitat.  Seedling mortality was very high, but age had no effect on \\nsurvival rates once plants were one year old. Most were small, only lived two years \\nand produced none or few flowers, although those that survived long enough \\ngenerally reached their maximum size and flowering potential when they were five \\nyears old. The number of plants present across the whole of Ben Lawers  halved \\nbetween 1996 and 2014, with half of all colonies extinct and a further third in \\nsignificant decline.  The greatest threats to S. nivalis  in Scotland were identified as \\nhabitat damage due to natural processes, sheep activity and climate change. A \\nreduction in snow cover may cause an interaction between these factors and \\ncompromise the long -term survival of rear edge populations of this species, other \\nrare arctic -alpines in Scotland and their associated contribution to biodiversity.  \\n \\nKey words : Snow pe arlwort ; conservation ; demography ; longevity ; threats ; climate \\nchange  \\n \\nIntroduction  \\nPopulations located at the low -latitude margins of a species’ distribution (rear edge) \\nare of important conservation value because they can be rich in genetic diversity, \\nexhibit distinct local adaptations and contain unique ecoty pes (Hampe & Petit, 2005; \\nRehm et al., 2015).  Rear edge populations therefore deserve high priority  for \\ninvestigation in order to preserve the evolutionary potential of the species and \\nmaintain bio diversity through  anticipated global change (Provan & Maggs , 2011) , yet \\nsuch ecological research is currently limited (Hampe & Petit, 2005 ).51 \\n The arctic -alpine flora of Scotland’s mountains is  of international significance  as \\nit contains many  rare species at the rear edge of their global ran ge (Sydes , 2008). \\nMontane plants may be sensitive to environmental change because they are often \\nintolerant of competition  and heavy grazing,  are specifically adapted to low \\ntemperatures  and exist in fragile and dynamic habitats  (Milne & Hartley , 2001; Björk \\n& Molau , 2007) . Populations that are small and isolated  are particularly at risk  \\n(Sydes , 2008) .   \\nThe conservation  management  of vulnerable  species  requires a considerable \\nknowledge of existing populations and the factors affecting them over the short and \\nlong-term, as well as an understanding of important aspects of their life histories \\nsuch as longevity , survival rates and fecundity. The most effective populat ion studies \\nare those that use permanently marked plots o ver decadal timescales (Geddes & \\nMiller , 2010; Ross , 2015) but the remote location of montane species usually \\npreclu des such work . Detailed life  history  information has been recorded for very few \\nof Scotland’s threatened plants (Legg et al., 1997), and empirical data on survival \\nand life span is lacking for pla nts in general (Lauenroth & Adler, 2008) , particularly \\narctic -alpines (Morris & Doak, 1998).    \\n The snow  pearlwort, Sagina nivalis  (Lindblom) Fr. , is one of Britain\\'s rarest and \\nleast known arctic -alpine  plants  (Wigginton , 1999) . It is a dwarf, tufted cushion -\\nforming perennial with tiny white flowers which open only on sunny days between \\nJuly and September , and are automatically self -pollinated (Clapham  et al., 1962) . \\nBecause of the pla nt’s inconspicuous  growth  form, it can be found only by careful \\nobservation, and often eludes even skilled botanists. Images  in Plate 1  are provided \\nat higher resolution in supplementary files Image1 – Image5 in TIFF format .  \\n The species has a  predominantly arctic  and sub-arctic  circumpolar distribution  \\nin the Northern Hemisphere  but has also been reported from the western Alps \\n(Benum , 1958; Clapham et al., 1962). The Scottish populations are at the extreme \\nsouthern margin of its north European range and are  confined to a few mountains in \\nthe Breadalbane region of the Central Highlands. This restricted British distribution \\ncurrently appears to be associated with a combination of environmental factor s: high \\naltitude, calcareous mica -schist bedrock and a low maximum temperature (Evans , \\n1982).  The vast majority of known locations  are within the Ben Lawers  Site of \\nSpecial Scientific Interest  (SSSI)  at altitudes between 915 and 1192 m. Records of S. \\nnivalis  were few prior to the 1980s  when the  species was found to be no longer \\npresent on the summit rocks on Ben Lawers (Raven & Walters , 1956), and by 1981 , \\nit had  disappeared from two of the three sites recorded in 1980 (D .K. Mardon, \\npersonal observation). Concerns were expressed for its vulnerability for local \\nextinction . Fortunately, a comprehensive survey in 1981 found enough  colonies  and \\na sufficient number  of plants to discount the possibility that the species was \\ncurrently endangered  (Payne , 1981) . However, the Ben Lawers SSSI is subject to \\nserious pressures from grazing animals and recreational use , and casual \\nobservations of the p lant’s habitat suggested that it was particularly vulnerable to \\ndisturbance.  \\n This paper describes the results of a long-term study to monitor the population \\ndynamics, turnover rate and life history  of S. nivalis with the aim of  identify ing \\npotential threats to the conservation  of this arctic -alpine at its rear edge in  Scotland . \\nSpecifically, data gathered from ten permanent plots on the Ben Lawers range \\nbetween 1982 and 1994 were used to address the following questions:  \\n1. How d id the number of plants in the plots change  during the study period  and \\nwhat factors were responsible for any fluctuations ?52 \\n 2. What is the lifespan of the species and how did this vary between the study \\nplots?  \\n3. How did plant survival vary with age ? \\n4. What was the size range of the plants and how did this vary with age?  \\n5.

The geology of the SSSI includes soft Dalradian \\ncalcareous mica schists which give rise to basic soils. It is arguably the most \\nimportant site in Brita in for montane plants  and has been designated  also as a \\nSpecial Area of Conservation and a National Scenic Area. In addition to S. nivalis  it \\nsupports populations of around 16 other nationally rare vascular plant  species  \\n(Wigginton , 1999) , as well as  a significant number of rare bryophytes and lichens.  \\n \\nSagina nivalis study plots  (1981 -1994)  \\nTen permanent study plots for S. nivalis were established  in 1981 across four \\nmountains within the Ben Lawers SSSI (Beinn Ghlas, Ben Lawers, An Stuc and Meall \\nGarbh) . Observations that year showed that the plant  typically grows on a surface \\nmat of bryophytes over a substrate of calcareous gravels , both on ground subject  to \\nfrequent flushing and on drier rock ledges. The sites were therefore chosen to  \\nencompass this habitat variation , at altitudes of between 970-1160 m, and on range \\nof slope angles and aspects, while also allowing field observations to be complet ed \\nin a minimum amount of time, estimated at two or three days  annually . The Ben \\nLawers  range is grazed by sheep from adjacent farms, some with heritable grazing \\nrights on the NTS land. Deer also use the area but were never observed on or near \\nthe study sites during the project or on numerous visits since.  Numbers  of sheep  \\nalso far exceed  those of  deer. P lots 1, 2 and  3 were inaccessible to sheep  grazing, \\nbut are sometimes affected by rockfalls caused  by sheep . Other species commonly \\nfound in the plots  included  Cochlearia micacea, Sagina saginoides, Salix herbacea \\nand Saxifraga oppositifolia . In the wet flushes  the moss  Blindia acuta  was almost \\ninvariably present, frequently with  the higher plant associates  Juncus triglumis, \\nSaxifraga stellaris, and often  Juncus biglumis . On the drier sites S. nivalis was \\naccompanied by Alchemilla alpina, Festuca vivipara,  Minuartia sedoides, Silene \\nacaulis, and sometimes Saxifraga nivalis.  \\n A study plot of approximately ¼  m2 was chosen because of the diminutive \\nform of the species  (described below) . This size was  roughly the extent of many \\ncolonies, was convenient for fitting onto the ledges where they occurred  and was \\nthe optimal dimensions  for producing a useful photographi c record.  The corners \\nwere marked by woode n pegs of c.20  mm square section inserted to ground level \\nand topped with a wire nail for attaching string to define the plot’s boundary. Plot \\nshape varied with the feasibility of placing \\'permanent\\' markers, and with the terrain, \\nand was roughly squ are, rectangular , trapezoidal  or triangular. Permanence could \\nnot be assured, due to the dynamic  nature of the habitats.  It was therefore \\nadvantageous to visit certain sites each spring to reposition marker peg s dislodged \\nby frost heave and note  any other evidence of disturbance during the winter.  All \\nmarkers were removed at the end of the study.  \\n The study plots were visited annually in August  or very soon after,  from 1982 -\\n1994, to record  the number of plants present. Initially, each individual was marked \\nby a temporary tag as an aid to counting.  Searching for the small and often \\ninconspicuous pear lworts was slow and time -consum ing, and plants, once spotte d, \\ncould easily b e overlooked when counting . The tags overcame this difficulty  by \\nseparating the search and find operation from the counting and recording, thus \\nenhancing the accuracy of the results.  Each tag was a \"flag\" of plastic adhesive tape \\non a 40  mm zinc -coated panel pin. Such a marker  caused negligible habitat damage \\nand was an optimal size for photographic recording. Two colours w ere used, red and \\nyellow, cut into three different shapes to distinguish six categories as follows:54 \\n  \\n1. Large flowering - longest diameter at least c.25  mm; \\n2. Medium flowering - longest diameter in the range 13 -25 mm; \\n3. Small flowering - longest diameter less than 13  mm; \\n4. Non flowering  - generally small; size not categorised;  \\n5. Seedling  - minute, usually  with only one pair of leaves (cotyledons), sometimes \\nwith a second pair, but with the potential for misidentification,  often growing in \\ndense clusters .  Assumed to be < 1 year old, germinated in th e current season.  \\nIf developed enough for confident identification, some isolated seedlings could \\nbe tagged, but an overall count was not realistic.  \\n6. Dead, dying - helped  to account for  plants tha t had died since the last visit.  \\nSome such remains were recognisable more than a year after death . \\n \\nA photographic record of the plots each year assisted  the relocation of plants \\non subsequent visits and provide d a gross visual indication of changes in the \\ndistribution of individuals  and structure of a colony, including destructive events that \\ndirectly affect ed the population. The photographs were on 35  mm colour negative \\nfilm, to facilitate printing in the days of only analogue photography.  Field notes also \\nincluded any other relevan t information, for example  signs of disturbance  such as \\nhoof prints or landslip .   \\nDuring the years  1983-1993 life history  information was also  recorded at eight \\nof the plots , as follows:  \\n \\n1. the location of each individual plant, defined by its distance from  the two \\nlowest, i.e. nearest, corner pegs, measured to the nearest 5  mm; \\n2. its overall size, measured as the product of the greatest diameter and that at \\n90°; \\n3. the number of flowers, counted with the aid of a seeker (a small metal probe, \\n1mm thick, angled and mounted on a handle, for biological use).  Any seed \\ncapsules already present were also counted as (former) flowers.    \\n \\nCollecting this amount of data  annually  from Plots 2 and 10 proved impractical \\nbecause of the large number of plants (in 1983), which took an excessive time to \\nrecord, and entailed errors  in recognising individuals. Also, the precarious position of \\nPlot 2 posed great er personal risk  than other sites. Size and flowering measurements \\nwere taken for flowering plants in Plot 10 only in 1983 and 1985.  \\n The number of flowers (or capsules) counted on the plants during a single visit \\nto the study plots was assumed to be the total produced by each individual o ver the \\ncourse of the whole season. While it is possible that some flowers were missed, this \\npossible  error was minimised by ensuring that monitoring took place once the peak \\nof flowering had occurred, which early observations suggested was in August.  \\nThe coordinates were recorded or re-recorded so that the progress of each \\nindividual could be tracked throughout the study. However, data from the first three  \\nyears showed that the  positions of plants change d from year to year, presumably \\ndue to sh ifting of the surface crust, or of the marker pegs, with frost heave.  Also, \\nthe ‘centre’ of a plant would appe ar to move by asymmetrical growth from the stock: \\nthe basal rosette is not distinguishable in mature plants.  Since 1986 therefore, to aid \\nrecognition of individual plants, they were also \\'permanently\\' tagged with coloured \\nhaberdash ery pins, although these too beca me dislodged in some cases.55 \\n Some a dult plants seemed to appear spontaneously  and presumably had be en \\noverlooked or not recorded as seedlings. The vast majority of these were small and \\nnon-flowering and so they were classed as 1-year olds.  \\nAlthough life  history  data were not collected in 1982 or 1994, it was possible to \\ngain additional information about the age  of some plants using the photographs . An \\nindividual that first appeared as a seedling or an adult in 1983 could have its lifespan \\nmeasured . Any adult plant present in an identical location in the 1982 and 1983  \\nphotographs was assu med to be th e same individual.  It was not possible to \\ndetermine age and lifespan in this case because the plant may have been alive \\nbefore the study began.  Any plant present in 1993 that disappeared from the 1994 \\nphotograph was assumed to have died . Lifespan could not  be recorded for \\nindividuals still alive in 1994.  \\n \\nFull population surveys (1996 & 2014)  \\nThe total number of plants present at each of the 37 S. nivalis  colonies found on the \\nBen Lawers range during the original 1981 survey was counted during subsequent \\nvisits in  1996 and 2014  (MacGregor, 1996; Watts, 2014) . The status of each colony \\nwas assessed  in 2014  as being either:  \\n1. Extinct; no plants found  \\n2. Declining (a loss of  ≥ 30% of plants present in 1996)  \\n3. Stable (no significant change in plant numbers since 1996 ) \\n4. Increasing (an increase of ≥ 30% of plants present in 1996)  \\n \\nData analysis  \\nWe marked 437 seedlings  with temporary tags, but many more would have been \\nmissed using the method detailed (as explained above). The seedling stage was \\ntherefore not included in the data analysis, and the results apply to plants that \\nreached at least one year of age.  A life table of survival and mortality was \\nconstructed using the calculations  described in Begon et. al.  (1996) , except that the \\nfecundity schedule ( the last two columns  of Table 2 ) relates to the number of \\nflower s produced rather than the actual number of offspring  produced . Each \\nconsecutive year of life was defined as a separate age class.   \\nThe v ariation in plant lifespan between the study plots was tested using \\nAnalysis -of-variance ( ANOVA ). Normal distribution of the original data and the \\nresiduals was confirmed using the Kolmogorov –Smirnov test and histograms.  Equal \\nvariance was determined usin g Levene’s test. A post hoc Tukey’s multiple \\ncomparison test was used to identify which plots differed significantly from each \\nother at the 95% confidence level. Variation in the diameter of the plants with age \\nwas tested using a repeated measures General Linear Model. The data w ere log \\ntransformed and combined for 8 and 9 -year old plants due to the small sample size  \\nin these categories .  \\nPlant area was calculated by multiplying the diameter (greatest distance \\nmeasured across the plants) by the width at 90º  to the longest width . The resulting \\nfigure, however, overestimates the total area , as the cushions are not rectangular \\nand the foliage can vary in density.  The relat ionship between plant area and number \\nof flowers was tested using  linear regression . This included a small number of plants \\nmeasured in Plot 10 in 1983 and 1985.  Plants still alive at the end of the study \\nexcluded from  the analyses of lifespan and maximum size. Plants already present \\nbefore the study began were only included in the analysis involving the relationship \\nbetween the number of flowers and pl ant size.56 \\n  \\nResults  \\nPopulation dynamics  \\nFig. 1 shows  the po pulation dynamics  observed in the ten study plot s. Fig. 1a gives \\nthe data for the two plots  with the highest densities of S. nivalis  (Plots 2 and 10 ), \\nwhich follow  very similar curves, the result of two diff erent causes, described below.  \\nIn Figs 1b-d plots are grouped according to some physical changes that affected  the \\nhabitat  (overgrowth of vegetation, disturbance caused by sheep or flooding) .  \\n The numbers of individuals recorded at different sites ranged from 0 to 180, \\nwith both extremes recorded on  Plot 10. All locations showed marked fluctuations, \\nsometimes doubling, trebl ing or even quadrupling, or crashing, between consecutive \\nyears  (i.e. the interval between annual visits). These p eaks and troughs did not \\ncoincide between plots;  however , the overall pattern of change was a rapid increase \\nfollowed by a slower, progressive  and serious decrease (Fig. 2).  This trend was the \\nresult of the high abundance of S. nivalis  in Plots 2 and 10 (Fig. 1a), which included \\ntwo-thirds of the plants recorded at the overall peak in 1985.  These data illustrate \\nthe difficulty that would apply to any attempt to use samples of the overall \\npopulation to measure trends. Nevertheless, most sites were in decline over the later \\nyears of the project.  \\n Table 1 summari ses the overall trends and most important events which took \\nplace at each study plot.

The plants in \\nPlots 1 and 3 had a significantly longer lifespan than those at all other sites except \\nPlot 5.

However the age specific mortality rate ( qx) was highest for \\nseedlings and lowest for plants of 3 years of age, after which there was only a slight \\nincreasing trend until the plants reached 9 years. In fact, the survivorship (Fig. 4)  \\ndisplays a classic Deevey Type II curve with constant mortality. Individuals therefore \\nexperienced a constant chance of surviving from one a ge to the next throughout \\ntheir lives once they passed the seedling stage.61 \\n \\n012345\\n1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9Years\\nStudy plot \\nFigure 3 .

Although areas of up to 24.75 cm2 were recorded, 33% and \\n50% of al l plants never grew to more than 0.5 cm2 and 1 cm2 respectively. Only 3% \\never reached more than 10 cm2.62 \\n  \\nTable 2 .

One -\\nyear old plants had a mean diameter of 9.07 mm (± 1SE 0.24 , n = 422 ) which \\nincreased each year until they reached 19.47 mm (± 1SE 1.44 , n = 59) at 5 years \\nold. Plants that survived lo nger than this tended not to grow any further, and v ery \\nold plants were observed dying back  in their last year of life.  8 and 9 -year olds had a \\nmean diameter of 14.78 mm (± 1SE 2.67, n = 9).   \\n \\nFlowering  \\nOn average p lants produced a  mean  of 4 flowers throughout the  entire  duration of \\ntheir lifespan , with the most important age classes for fl owering being 2 -5 years \\n(Table 2 ). 57.5% of plants never grew any flowers at all before they died but a small \\nproportion (4.7%) did generate  at least 25 flowers  over their lifetime .  For those \\nplants which did produce flowers, the  mean age of first flowering was 2.30 years ( ± \\n1SE 0.072 , n = 197 ). If an individual lived long enough it generally produced  an \\nincreasing number of flowers each year  until it was 5 years of age, although v ery old \\nplants had fewer flowers  (see column mx, Table 2 ). There was a strong positive \\nrelationship  between flower number and plant area ( r2 = 0.71, n = 1278, p < 0.001)  \\n(Fig. 5). One individual grew as m any as 123 flowers over its entire lifespan (8 \\nyears), with 50 of these produced when it was 5 years old and had reached its \\nmaximum size of 17.5  cm2. Thus, the most fecund plants were a small number of \\nlarge, long -lived individuals , with the vast majority be ing diminutive  and developing  \\nfew or no flowers .63 \\n  \\n \\nFigure 5 . Relationship between the number of flowers produced by Sagina \\nnivalis  and plant size . \\n \\n \\nFull population surveys (1996 & 2014)  \\nIn total, 3714 plants were counted across Ben Lawers  in 1996 but only 1848 in \\n2014, which represents a decline of 50.24% after 18 years. Of the 37 individual \\ncolonies which were surveyed, 19 (51.3%) were extinct, 12 (32.4%) had declined \\nsignificantly, two (5.4%) were stable and only four (10.8%) had increased.  \\n \\nDiscussion  \\nLong-term monitoring of individuals of Sagina nivalis  within fixed plots on Ben \\nLawers has revealed dramatic fluctuations in the numbers over 1 4 years . Most of \\nthese fluctuations were associated with the physical instability of the habitat  in which \\nS. nivalis  occurs , indicating that the population dynamics of the species are strongly \\ninfluenced by the fragile nature of its montane environment  which is highly \\nsusceptible to disturbance caused by rockfalls, trampling and flooding . Individuals in \\nPlots 1 and 3 had significantly longer lifespans than those in the other study plots  (P \\n< 0.001 ), and with the exception a landslip event in Plot 1 early in the study, these \\nsites were subject to fewer observable changes  (as was Plot 5).  Habitat dynamism \\nfor S. nivalis  is chiefly derived from natural, ongoing erosion of cliffs and steep \\nslopes, combined with frost heave, rockfalls, and in some places, occasional \\ninundation with water.  When accelerated (sometimes by sheep ) these \\ngeomorpholo gical events can catastrophically reduce populations or even cause \\nthem to disappear entirely.   \\n However, su ch processes maintain  suitably open habitat for S. nivalis  by \\npreventing encroachment by more competitive grasses, sedges, herbs and mosses . \\nIf left undisturbed t he plots tended  to become overgrown with vegetatio n towards \\nthe end of the study which also  coincided with population declines.  In fact, alpine \\nsnow bed plants are sensitive to competition  because a denser canopy reduces light \\navailabilit y (Austrheim & Eriksson , 2001) and belowground competition may be \\nparticularly severe in nutrient -poor high mountain pioneer soils ( Dullinger & Hülber , y = 1.67x - 0.85 \\nR² = 0.71  \\n0102030405060\\n0 5 10 15 20 25No. flowers  \\nArea (cm2)64 \\n 2011), although this may not be so relevant at Ben Lawers.  In addition, \\nenvironmental disturbances can be important for creating the conditions favourable \\nfor arctic -alpine seedling establishment (Chambers , 1995).   \\n Alternatively , the longer lifespan of the plants in Plots 1 and 3 could  be related \\nto their lower population  densities , which would have reduc ed the level of \\ncompetition between S. nivalis plants. Both sites also  included areas of bare rock, \\nparticularly Plot 3, which would have provided fewer niches for colonisation by S. \\nnivalis or indeed other competitive species, hence the lower levels of vegetation \\nencroachment at these locations . \\n The life history of the species also reflects its dynamic and unstable habitat.  \\nThe majority of plants were extremely short -lived, diminutive and de veloped few or \\nno flowers. Plants with short lifespans often occur in open, disturbed areas (García \\net al., 2007).  This study also found that individuals experienced a constant chance of \\nsurviving from one age to the next throughout their lives once they passed the \\nseedling stage. A Type-II survivorship curve could be a characteristic of alpine \\nperennials because the e xtreme abiotic stresses they are subjected to maintain \\nconsistent mortality rates during all stages of their life span.  Local environmental \\nconditions can exert an important influence on the shape of a survivorship curve \\n(Aziz & Khan, 1993) . However, the cushion -forming Silene  acaulis , which can grow \\nalongside S. nivalis , instead follows a characteristic Type-III survivorship curve and \\nis much longer lived (Morris & Doak, 1998). But it has extremely high mortality rates \\nin the early years of life, as does S. nivalis  during the seedling stage.   \\nHigh mortality of seedlings is an important component of the selection \\noperating in  plant life cycles (Silvertown & Dickie, 1980) and is not uncommon in \\narctic -alpine environments (Chambers , 1995; Forbis , 2003). For S. nivalis this may \\nbe because the seeds germinate where they drop, usually close to mature plants. \\nThis creates clusters of seedlings so dense that few plants could ever grow to \\nmaturity.  The reproductive ecology of many arctic alpines, in terms of dispersal \\ndistances, vegetative spread or regeneration, seed longevity or the existence of any \\nseed bank in the soil , is poorly known . A highly restricted seed dispersal capacity has \\nbeen recorded for other snowbed species and passively dispersed alpine pl ants \\n(Scherff et al., 1994).  Evidence of short -range seed dispersal of S. nivalis by gravity \\nwas provided by the regeneration of the entire colony in study Plot 4 after it was \\nwiped out by a landslip in 1983. Thus, it is conceivable that the minute seeds o f S. \\nnivalis  are dispersed by wind or carried downhill by the flow of surface water and \\nsnowmelt. It is also possible that entire individuals or plant fragments that have \\nbeen uprooted could take root elsewhere, which may explain the occasional \\nappearance of some new adult plants within the plots.  \\nThis study found correlations between plant age, size, and the number of \\nflowers in S. nivalis , with  such relationships documented across a range of plant \\nspecies (Silvertown , 1985; Waller , 1988; Weiner , 1988; Ollerton & Lack, 1998; Pires \\net al., 2014). In fact, the neighbouring Silene acaulis also increased in cushion \\ndiameter with age (Morris & Doak, 1998). Plant size is usually considered a \\npredominantly environmentally influenced characteristic, determined b y plant age \\nand growing conditions (Waller , 1988; Ollerton & Lack, 1998).  Flowering \\nperformance was the only reproductive attribute that could be recorded in our field \\nstudy. Unidentified and unmeasured variables may be affecting other attributes, e.g. \\npollination rates, seed production, fertility and germination.65 \\n  \\nImplications for c onservation  \\nThis study has indicated that a small proportion of individuals with in populations of \\nSagina nivalis  have considerably greater longevity and fecundity than  the vast \\nmajority. These long -lived individuals may impart some long -term stability to the \\npopulations. It appears that maximum size and reproductive capacity is achieved by \\nplants that live to 5 years of age. Therefore, populations may be at risk from \\ninstabilities and changes in the habitat that prevent at least some plants from \\nreaching this age. Such threats recognised from this study and other, ongoing \\nobservations at Ben Lawers include natural and anthropogenic factors, which are not \\nnecessarily unrel ated: \\n1. Habitat damage from natural, dynamic processes  \\n2. Impact of human recreational activities  \\n3. Direct impact of sheep   \\n4. Climate change  \\nGeomorphological processes have already been discussed above. Erosion and \\ndisturbance by hillwalking can significantly dama ge montane habitats (Bayfield , \\n1979; Bayfield et al., 1981; Thompson  et al., 1987), particularly at popular hills such \\nas Ben Lawers.  Here the main walking routes at present do not coincide with S. \\nnivalis  habitat, and so human activity is unlikely to pose  a significant threat to the \\noverall population. Localised trampling by botanically interested visitors has been \\nobserved where the habitat is shared with several other rare or scarce species.  \\nHowever, s heep trampling  destroyed plants and caused a signific ant decline in \\nthe populations of S. nivalis  at Plots 9 and 10. Its potential as  a threat is also \\nsuggested  by the fact that the plots with the longest mean plant lifespan, 1 and 3, \\nwere the only inaccessible locations (as well as Plot 2, which was not included in the \\nlifespan analysis).  It is doubtful that S. nivalis  is selectively grazed due to its low \\nprofile and any effects of dung and urine are not known. Grazing may provide some \\nbenefit fo r arctic -alpines by suppressing competing  species and facili tating \\nrecruitment through small -scale disturbances (Austrheim & Eriksson , 2001), although \\nthis has not yet been observed for S. nivalis . Nevertheless, it is generally thought \\nthat a reduction in sheep grazing in montane Britain will promote the conservati on of \\nsome summit communities ( Thompson  et al., 1987; Thompson & Brown , 1992). At \\nBen Lawers this is dependent upon the NTS acquiring heritable grazing rights \\ncurrently owned by several independent farmers.  \\n The overall pattern of population change throughout this study was a rapid \\nincrease in numbers of S. nivalis followed by a slower, progressive and serious \\ndecline since 1985.  Furthermore, the number of plants present across the whole of \\nBen Lawers SSSI has  halved between 1996 and 2014, with half of all colonies now \\nextinct and a further third in significant decline  (Watts, 2014) . These trends, along \\nwith the  association with snow  that is  implicit in the species name, suggest that \\nclimate change could be having  a serious impact on S. nivalis in Scotland.  There has \\nbeen a declining trend in the number of days of snow cover at Ben Lawers between \\n1979 and 2003, particularly, at 900m (Trivedi et. al. , 2007). This has been obvious \\nsince the beginning of the 1990s, in contrast to the initial years of the study when \\nthe plots became buried by early, autumnal snowfalls  which provided months -long \\ncontinuity of cover  (D.K. Mardon, personal observation ). \\n The snow cover at 1060m is projected to be reduced by 21% by the 2050s \\nunder a low greenhouse gas emissions scenario and by 32% under a high emissions \\nscenario (Trivedi et. al. , 2007). Climate change  has already caused biotic66 \\n homogenization of the Scottish uplands through an increase in generalists, such as \\ngraminoids, and a decline in specialist arctic -montane species (Ross et. al. , 2012). \\nSnow is probably critically important for S. nivalis because it protects alpine habitats  \\nfrom erosive processes such as freeze -thaw cycles and suppresses compet ing \\nspecies by shortening the growing season (Belsky & Moral , 1980; Björk & Molau , \\n2007). This may be one reason why  vegetation encroachment occurred in 9 out of \\n10 plots towards the e nd of the study.  A reduction in snow duration will also allow \\ngreater access by sheep , thereby  increasing grazing impacts (Austrheim & Eriksson , \\n2001) and accelerating  slippage and rockfalls through hoof action on soils made \\nunstable by frost heave  (D.K. Mardon, personal observation ). An interaction between \\nthreats 1, 3 and 4 is therefore likely (Trivedi et. al. , 2008).  As a result, S. nivalis  may \\nbe one of the most vulnerable of all British vascular plants to climate change . \\nConsequently, the rear edge population of this species and its associated biodiversity \\nvalue and evolutionary potential is at risk . The results of this study also have \\nimplications for populations of other rare Scottish arctic -alpines residing in similar  \\nhabitats, for example Minuartia rubella and Saxifraga cernua , as it is likely that they \\nwill likewise  be subjected to the threats imposed on S. nivalis . \\n Monitoring is essential for detecting trends in montane communities and for \\ndeveloping conservation policies, particularly in the face of climate change (Trivedi \\net. al. , 2008). The documentation of the distribution and abundance of the rare plant \\nspecies at Ben Lawers has been mostly carried out by employees of the NTS, the \\nowner  of the NNR as currently designated. It is unlikely that landowners other than \\nconservation bodies would undertake the time -consuming, detailed observations \\nneeded to understand and conserve such species.  Of the 1,848 S. nivalis  plants \\nrecorded  in 2014, 78 % were on NTS land . Therefore, the Trust has a unique \\nresponsibility for the future of the species in Scotland. We believe that the ability to \\nenhance and promote understanding of it, as well as others in a similar but less \\nextreme situation, will depend o n the long -term continuity of resident staff with an \\necological bias at Ben Lawers.  \\n \\nEnvironmental and Experimental Botany 88 (2013) 93– 99\\nContents  lists  available  at  SciVerse  ScienceDirect\\nEnvironmental  and  Experimental  Botany\\njourna  l  h  omepa  g  e:  www.elsevier.com/locate/envexpbot\\nProtective responses induced by herbicide safeners in wheat\\nVictoria  L.

When wheat plants were spray-treated with three safener chemistries, namely\\ncloquintocet mexyl,  mefenpyr  diethyl  and  fenchlorazole  ethyl,  an  apparently  identical  subset  of  GSTs\\nderived from the tau, phi and lambda classes accumulated in the foliage. Treatment with the closely\\nrelated mefenpyr  diethyl  and  fenchlorazole  ethyl  enhanced  seedling  shoot  growth,  but  this  effect  was\\nnot determined  with  the  chemically  unrelated  cloquintocet  mexyl.  Focussing  on  cloquintocet  mexyl,\\ntreatments were  found  to  only  give  a  transient  induction  of  GSTs,  with  the  period  of  elevation  being  dose\\ndependent. Examining  the  role  of  safener  metabolism  in  controlling  these  responses,  it  was  determined\\nthat cloquintocet  mexyl  was  rapidly  hydrolysed  to  the  respective  carboxylic  acid.  Studies  with  cloquin-\\ntocet showed that the acid was equally effective at inducing GSTs as the ester and appeared to be the\\nactive safener.  Studies  on  the  tissue  induction  of  GSTs  showed  that  whilst  phi  and  tau  class  enzymes\\nwere induced  in  all  tissues,  the  induction  of  the  lambda  enzymes  was  restricted  to  the  meristems.

Introduction\\nSafeners are  an  important  group  of  agrochemicals  used  exten-\\nsively in  cereals  to  protect  crops  from  damage  caused  by  selective\\nherbicides without compromising weed control efﬁcacy (Davies\\nand Caseley,  1999;  Edwards  et  al.,  2005;  Hatzios,  2003;  Hatzios\\nand Burgos,  2004).The  mechanism  of  safener  action  most  widely\\naccepted is  that  these  chemicals  enhance  crop  tolerance  by\\ninducing the expression of proteins involved in the metabolism\\nof herbicides,  thus  accelerating  their  detoxiﬁcation  (Davies  and\\nCaseley, 1999;  Hatzios  and  Burgos,  2004).  Amongst  these  ‘safened’\\nenzymes, the best studied are the glutathione transferases (GSTs)\\nwhich catalyze  the  conjugation  of  herbicides  with  the  endoge-\\nnous tripeptide  glutathione  (Cummins  et  al.,  1997;  Davies  and\\nCaseley, 1999;  DeRidder  and  Goldsbrough,  2006).  Such  conjuga-\\ntion has been demonstrated in barley (Scalla and Roulet, 2002),\\nmaize (Fuerst  et  al.,  1993;  Scarponi  et  al.,  2006),  wheat  (Cummins\\n∗Corresponding author  at:  The  Food  and  Environment  Research  Agency,  Sand\\nHutton,\\n York  YO41  1LZ,  UK.

In  addition,  it  is  known  that  safeners  enhance  the  expression\\nof other  classes  of  detoxifying  enzymes  including  the  cytochrome\\nP450 mixed function oxygenases (Persans et al., 2001), type 1 glu-\\ncosyltransferases (UGTs)  (Brazier  et  al.,  2002)  and  ATP-binding\\ncassette (ABC)  transporter  proteins  in  a  range  of  plants  (Coleman\\net al.,  1997;  Riechers  et  al.,  2010).\\nOne intriguing characteristic of safeners is their apparent\\nspecies speciﬁcity,  with  different  classes  of  chemistry  being  devel-\\noped for  use  in  each  of  the  major  cereal  crops  (Riechers  et  al.,  2010).\\nIn addition, for each given species a number of different safener\\nchemistries have  been  developed.  For  example  in  wheat  (Triticum\\naestivum L.),  the  quinolinoxycarboxylic  acid  cloquintocet  mexyl,  as\\nwell as  the  unrelated  compounds  mefenpyr  diethyl  and  fenchlo-\\nrazole ethyl have been widely used as post-emergence safeners\\n(Fig. 1).  All  these  compounds  are  used  to  safen  aryloxyphenoxypro-\\npionate (AOPP)  herbicides  which  inhibit  the  essential  enzyme\\nacetyl CoA  carboxylase.  All  chemical  classes  of  safener  are  known\\nto functionally  exert  their  protective  effect  by  enhancing  herbi-\\ncide detoxiﬁcation  in  wheat.  For  example,  cloquintocet  mexyl  is\\nknown to  increase  the  rate  of  hydroxylation,  ether  cleavage,  and\\n0098-8472 ©  2012 Elsevier B.V. \\ndoi:10.1016/j.envexpbot.2011.12.030Open access under CC BY license.\\nOpen access under C C BY license.94 V.L.

In each case, whilst\\nthe safeners have been individually shown to enhance the activities\\nor expression  of  several  classes  of  herbicide-metabolising  enzymes,\\nthere have been no reported attempts to compare the relative efﬁ-\\ncacy of these chemicals in inducing detoxiﬁcation responses either\\nqualitatively or quantitatively. It is also clear that whilst wheat\\nsafeners are  predominantly  used  commercially  to  enhance  toler-\\nance towards a speciﬁc partner herbicide, this protective ability\\nextends to multiple classes of chemistry. For example, in addition to\\nsafening the AOPP herbicide fenoxaprop ethyl in wheat, mefenpyr\\ndiethyl also  increases  the  selectivity  ratio  of  the  unrelated  sulfonyl\\nureas mesosulfuron-methyl and iodosulfuron methyl-sodium by\\nenhancing their  detoxiﬁcation  (Hacker  et  al.,  2000).\\nUsing cloquintocet mexyl, mefenpyr diethyl and fenchlorazole\\nethyl as  different  classes  of  safener  (Fig.  1),  we  now  address  whether\\nor not  distinct  chemistries  invoke  different  responses  in  detoxify-\\ning enzymes  in  wheat.  We  then  use  different  treatment  regimes  to\\ntest the longevity and dose dependence of response and evaluate\\nthe ability  of  safeners  to  protect  wheat  from  soil  borne  chemical\\npollutants in  addition  to  herbicides.\\n2.\\n Materials  and  methods\\n2.1.

The  detergent  formulant\\nBiopower®was  provided  by  Bayer  Crop  Science  (Cambridge,  UK).\\nTo prepare  cloquintocet  acid,  a  solution  of  cloquintocet-mexyl\\n(100 mg, 0.3 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran:H 2O  (1:1,\\n5 mL)  and  treated  with  LiOH  (30  mg,  1.2  mmol)  at  room  temper-\\nature.

These  antisera  were\\nselected as  all  three  classes  were  known  to  be  induced  by  safeners\\nin wheat  (Cummins  et  al.,  1997;  Edwards  et  al.,  2005;  Theodoulou\\net al., 2003). Following SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, all three\\nantisera recognised  polypeptides  of  around  25  kDa  (Fig.  3),  which\\nis the  typical  relative  molecular  mass  of  a  GST  subunit.  The  tau\\n(GSTU) antiserum  recognised  polypeptides  in  the  control  samples\\nwhich were enhanced to similar degrees by all three safeners. The\\nphi anti-GSTF-serum  also  recognised  a  major  polypeptide  in  con-\\ntrol samples  whose  expression  was  enhanced  following  safener\\ntreatment. In addition, this antibody also recognised an inducible\\npolypeptide in the safened plants which migrated with a relative\\nmolecular mass of around 27 kDa. The lambda (GSTL) antiserum\\nidentiﬁed immunoreactive polypeptides in the safened samples\\nwhich were  not  detected  in  the  controls,  reﬂecting  the  strong  link\\nbetween the expression of this class of GST and chemical treatment\\n(Theodoulou et  al.,  2003).

Whilst  cloquinto-\\ncet mexyl  did  not  enhance  growth  over  this  period,  both  mefenpyr\\ndiethyl and fenchlorazole ethyl noticeably enhanced shoot length.\\nThis was associated with a gain in the proportion of dry weight, sug-\\ngesting this  was  due  to  assimilation  rather  than  just  cell  expansion\\n(Table 2).\\n3.2.

The  results  demonstrated  that\\ncloquintocet mexyl was rapidly hydrolysed to cloquintocet acid,\\nwhich then  accumulated  during  the  induction  period  (data  not\\nshown). To  determine  if  cloquintocet  acid  was  active  as  a  safener,\\nthe parent  ester  was  hydolysed  to  yield  the  free  acid  which  was\\nthen used  to  treat  the  wheat  shoots,  with  the  induction  of  GSTs\\nand GPOX  again  monitored  over  a  48  h  period  (Fig.  5).  The  results\\nobtained showed  that  the  free  acid  gave  essentially  an  identical\\nfold-induction overall  of  both  activities  to  the  parent  ester.  How-\\never, unlike  cloquintocet  mexyl,  the  cloquintocet  acid  only  gave\\nmaximal enhancement  after  24  h  of  treatment.  These  results  sug-\\ngested that  cloquintocet  acid  is  in  fact  the  active  safener,  with  the\\nester effectively  acting  as  an  uncharged  and  hydrophobic  precur-\\nsor which  assists  in  the  rapid  delivery  of  the  compound  across  the\\nwaxy cuticle  of  the  wheat  leaf.  As  such  the  effective  bioactivation\\nof the  safener  is  analogous  to  the  uptake,  hydrolysis  and  activation\\nof herbicide  esters  (Cummins  and  Edwards,  2004).\\nA series  of  simple  experiments  were  then  performed  to  deter-\\nmine the  dose  responsiveness  of  safening  using  a  single  applicationof\\n cloquintocet  mexyl  to  7-day-old  seedlings.  Normal  ﬁeld  rate\\napplications gave  a  58%  increase  in  GST  activity  24  h  after  treat-\\nment, with  a  very  similar  response  seen  with  the  50%  ﬁeld  rate\\ntreatment. Increasing  the  safener  dosage  above  ﬁeld  rate  gave  a\\nsmaller induction  of  GST  activity.  In  each  case,  maximal  induction\\nwas seen  at  24  h,  declining  thereafter  most  noticeably  at  the  lower\\napplication rates.\\nIt was  then  of  interest  to  study  the  GST  induction  response  in\\ndifferent plant  parts.  Wheat  seedlings  were  divided  into  leaves\\nand meristematic  tissues,  with  the  leaves  sub-divided  into  tips\\nand middle  sections.  After  normalising  protein  content,  the  sam-\\nples were  then  analysed  for  CDNB-conjugating  activity  and  phi,\\ntau and  lambda  GST  polypeptide  content  (Table  3).  These  results\\ndemonstrated that  GST  activity  in  the  control  plants  was  four-\\nfold higher  in  the  meristems  than  in  the  foliage,  there  being  no\\ndifferences between  the  tips  and  mid  sections  of  the  leaves.  In\\nterms of enzyme induction, the leaves were more responsive to\\nsafener than  the  meristems.  Based  on  the  Western  blotting  studies,\\nwhilst the  GSTUs  were  present  constitutively  in  both  tissue  types,\\nthe GSTFs  were  largely  restricted  to  the  meristems  in  the  control\\nplants. On safener treatment GSTFs began to accumulate in the\\nleaves, whereas  the  GSTLs  were  only  determined  in  the  meristems\\n(Table 3).\\n3.3.\\n Protective  effect  of  safeners  in  wheat  towards  soil-born\\npollutants\\nWhilst the protective properties of safeners towards herbi-\\ncides are  well  described  in  cereals  (Davies  and  Caseley,  1999),  the\\npotential for  these  compounds  to  enhance  tolerance  towards  less\\nselective phytotoxic chemicals has not been reported. In particular,\\nthe use  of  safeners  to  enhance  chemical  tolerance  in  plants  grown\\nin contaminated  environments  could  be  a  very  useful  new  tool  in\\nphytoremediation. To  examine  the  potential  utility  of  safeners  in\\nremediation applications,  soil  samples  from  a  ‘real’  contaminated\\nsite located  at  a  major  oil  reﬁnery  were  used.  In  addition  to  oil\\nresidues, this  soil  also  contained  elevated  levels  of  heavy  metals\\n(Table 1)  and  was  taken  from  a  site  which  had  proven  difﬁcult  to\\nestablish plants  on  in  the  ﬁeld.

These maize\\nand rice  safeners  compounds  had  also  been  shown  to  elevate  GST\\ncontent in  wheat  (Edwards  et  al.,  2005),  making  them  suitable\\nfor comparative treatments with cloquintocet mexyl. Wheat seeds\\nwere soaked for 24 h in the four different safeners and then sown\\non the surface of the contaminated soil, along with non-polluted\\ncontrols and  germination  and  growth  determined  over  a  14-day\\nperiod (Table 4). In the absence of safener pre-treatment, none of\\nthe seeds germinated on the contaminated soil, whereas cloquin-\\ntocet mexyl, benoxacor and dichlormid all gave similar results to\\nthose seen  in  the  control  soils.  However,  following  germination\\nthe resulting shoot growth of the safened seedlings was greatly\\nreduced compared  with  controls  and  by  the  end  of  the  14-day\\nperiod the  plants  were  showing  signs  of  chlorosis.  By  28  days  all\\nthe seedlings  exposed  to  the  polluted  soil  were  dead  irrespective  of\\ntreatment.\\n4. Discussion\\nOur results  offer  several  new  insights  into  the  action  of  safeners\\nin wheat. Using the induction of GSTs as a biomarker of detoxiﬁca-\\ntion we have demonstrated that distinct safener chemistries classes\\nessentially induce  identical  responses  in  wheat  seedlings,  and  that\\nthis effect  is  dose-dependent  with  respect  to  saturability  and  tran-\\nsience. Intriguingly,  the  two  chemically  related  safeners,  mefenpyr\\ndiethyl and  fenchlorazole  ethyl  also  provoked  a  growth  enhancing\\neffect. At  the  level  of  tissue  selectivity,  lambda  GSTLs  are  induced\\nonly in the meristems, whilst the phi GSTFs accumulate more dra-\\nmatically in  the  leaves.  Finally  we  have  shown  that  safeners  can  give\\na short  lived  protective  effect  to  wheat  during  the  early  stages  of\\ngermination and  growth  on  soils  contaminated  with  heavy  metals\\nand oil  residues.\\nBased on  the  observed  speed  of  the  safener  response,  it  is\\nclear that  these  compounds  must  be  rapidly  recognised  by  an  as\\nyet unknown receptor system which initiates major changes in\\ntranscription (Riechers  et  al.,  2010).  It  is  therefore  intriguing  that\\ndistinct chemical  classes  of  safeners  give  such  similar  detoxiﬁ-\\ncation responses,  suggesting  they  are  recognised  by  a  common\\nreceptor system. Recent studies in Arabidopsis with a chemical\\nseries based  on  fenclorim  were  strongly  suggestive  of  a  selec-\\ntive protein-based  receptor  system,  with  minor  changes  in  the\\nreactivity and size of the safener strongly affecting GST-inducing\\nactivity (Skipsey et al., 2011). Similarly, a protein which selec-\\ntively bound the safener dichlormid has been identiﬁed in maize,\\nthough its function remains unknown (Scott-Craig et al., 1998).\\nBoth fenclorim  and  dichlormid  show  the  characteristics  of  pro-\\ntein alkylating agents, suggesting they need to covalently bind\\nto the  receptor  target.  In  the  case  of  the  three  safeners  used  inthis study,  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  parent  compounds  would\\nserve as  alkylating  agents.  Instead  it  would  appear  more  likely\\nthat if  they  functioned  via  covalently  modifying  a  receptor  pro-\\ntein that  this  would  occur  following  the  formation  of  a  reactive\\nmetabolite. In  the  studies  with  cloquintocet  mexyl,  we  were  unable\\nto identify  any  downstream  metabolites  other  than  the  free  acid\\ncloquintocet. By  demonstrating  that  cloquintocet  was  as  active\\nat inducing  GSTs  as  the  parent  ester,  these  studies  did  demon-\\nstrate that  the  acid,  rather  than  the  ester,  was  more  likely  to  be\\nthe direct  source  of  safener  activity.  However,  the  potential  for\\na further  and  more  chemically  reactive  downstream  metabolite\\nto be  the  active  signalling  agent  is  yet  to  be  determined.  The\\ndose-dependence studies  did  show  that  there  is  a  saturable  thresh-\\nold for  the  response,  with  higher  concentrations  only  promoting\\na longer,  rather  than  a  larger,  induction  of  GST  activity.  This  is\\nsuggestive of  a  dynamic  detection  system  whereby  a  minimal  con-\\ncentration of  the  active  safening  agent  is  required  to  sustain  the\\nresponse.\\nThe differences  between  the  distribution  of  members  of  the\\ndifferent GST  families  in  leaves  and  meristems  before  and  after\\nsafening were  also  intriguing  and  potentially  important,  with\\nrespect to  the  protective  activity  of  these  compounds.  Safeners\\ntend to  protect  cereals  from  herbicides  such  as  the  AOPPs  which\\nwill predominantly  act  to  inhibit  fatty  acid  biosynthesis  in  the\\nrapidly dividing  cells  in  the  meristems.  Similarly,  other  ‘safened’\\nclasses of  herbicide  such  as  the  chloroacetanilides  (fatty  acid  elon-\\ngation inhibitors)  and  sulfonylureas  (branched  chain  amino  acid\\nsynthesis) will  be  most  potent  when  acting  on  rapidly  dividing\\nmeristematic cells.  Studies  in  the  related  T.  tauschii  have  sug-\\ngested that  the  induction  of  tau  GSTUs  in  the  cells  around  the\\ncoleoptiles is critical in deﬁning the protective activities of safeners\\n(Riechers et  al.,  2003).  It  is  therefore  interesting  that  the  induction\\nof lambda  GSTLs  is  also  speciﬁc  to  the  meristems.  The  GSTLs  have\\na well  established  but  as  yet  undeﬁned  relationship  with  safen-\\ning in  wheat  (Theodoulou  et  al.,  2003).  Recently,  we  have  shown\\nthat whilst  GSTLs  do  not  directly  detoxify  xenobiotics,  they  do  have\\nan important  antioxidant  function  in  which  they  can  couple  pro-\\ntective glutathione  thiol  and  polyphenol  metabolism  (Dixon  and\\nEdwards, 2010). The current work lends further evidence for the\\nfunctional importance of GSTLs in tolerance to chemically imposed\\nstress in  plants  and  suggests  that  such  protection  is  cell  type  spe-\\nciﬁc.\\nThe ﬁnding  that  safeners  can  stimulate  plant  growth  and  pro-\\nvide some  protection  to  wheat  germinating  in  essentially  toxic  soil\\nis also  of  potential  interest.  Several  agrochemicals,  most  notably\\nthe strobilurin fungicides, are known to give growth promoting\\neffects in  wheat  (Wu  and  von  Tiedemann,  2001).  Based  on  the\\nstudies presented  here  we  would  not  anticipate  the  safeners  to\\nhave any  long  term  yield  promoting  effects,  as  the  responses\\nthey invoke  are  too  transient.  Intriguingly,  the  growth  promoting\\nactivity must  be  distinct  from  the  suite  of  protective  responses\\nsafeners induce  in  wheat  as  shoot  growth  was  only  stimulated\\nby mefenpyr ethyl and fenchlorazole ethyl and not by cloquin-\\ntocet mexyl.  However,  the  production  of  thiols  and  antioxidant\\nsecondary metabolites  associated  with  safening  might  help  explain\\nthe protection  these  compounds  exerted  in  the  wheat  plants\\ngrown in the contaminated soil. For example the glutathione\\nknown to  accumulate  on  safening  would  be  useful  in  counteract-\\ning metal  ion  toxicity,  whilst  the  detoxiﬁcation  enzymes  would\\nprovide some protection against organic pollutants. The results\\nto date suggest that such protection only extends during the\\nperiod in which the plantlets are growing from their own seed-\\nborn reserves. Nevertheless these observations with respect to\\ngrowth promotion  and  enhanced  chemical  tolerance  do  point  to\\nnew applications for safeners in agriculture and potentially phy-\\ntoremediation.V.L.

Monitoring \\nwas done in spring when the annual maximum herbivore impact accumulates on the \\nheather. We  estimated deer presence from pellet -group counts, and for heather we \\nmeasured cover, height and shoot browsing. Deer numbers declined earlier in Glen \\nDerry, and correspondingly heather height increased sooner. Trends in Glen Lui \\nwere related to plot wetne ss and distance from places where the deer were fed in \\nwinter; dry plots received much heavier usage from deer and rabbits initially, \\nkeeping the heather short and cover stable, whereas on wet plots usage was much \\nlower and heather increased both in cover and height. Subsequently, as deer \\ndensities fell, the Lui heather thrived, and by 2013 heather height on dry plots had \\nsurpassed height on wet plots. Colonisation by pine saplings was very patchy, being \\nvirtually confined to plots within 50 m of mature tre es and having heather swards \\nless than 25 cm tall. Despite deer numbers falling, saplings still suffered browsing by \\nblack grouse, lagomorphs and voles. Annual increments were greatest on dry plots \\nin Glen Lui. However, we estimate that another eight years  of negligible deer \\nnumbers are needed for the present sapling crop to become safe from deer damage. \\nA limited regime of burning near mature pines may assist regeneration.  \\n \\nKey Words : heather ; plant communities; red deer; Scots pine ; uplands;  woodland \\nregeneration  \\n \\nIntroduction  \\nWhich landscapes and vegetation types  are wanted in the British uplands is currently \\nreceiving much debate, with widely divergent options  advocated  by different \\norganisations , landowners, and the general public . Some want attractive open \\nlandscapes for recreation, some w ant sporting use including deer stalking and \\ngrouse shooting, some want agricultural production, some want the conservation or \\nrestoration of  habitat types that have become rare in recent times, some wa nt \\nwildness with no noticeable human impacts , and several other demands and outputs \\nare locally important . A new review on upland management in Scotland (Morgan -\\nDavies et al., 2015) employed two dichotomies in consider ing these uses:21 \\n management  either  for “the few” or for “the many” and management either for an \\noutput of  consumables or  for provid ing non-consumable values or “delights”.  The \\nauthors  documented  a recent swing  towards “delights for the many”  that now \\ninfluenc es much upland management, so no longer do a few owners  with large \\nestates  control  the Scottish uplands exclusively for their own purposes.  \\nTo achieve any of these diverse objectives , knowledge is required on the \\nresponse  of the main upland vegetation types  to different management regimes , \\nespecially if they develop into different communities , and on the time scale of such \\nsuccessions.  Much is now known about the Scottish uplands, as shown by the wide \\nvariety of  papers  included in a book edited by  Thompson  et al. (1995) , but th ese \\nstudies  deal largely with cultural moorlands managed by burning. In such moorlands \\nthe natural successions to woodland are prevented in order  that dwarf shrubs \\nparticularly heather ( Calluna vulgaris ) can flourish and provide good food and habitat \\nfor livestock and game birds, these being a gricultural or sporting management s.  \\nFor a recovery of native woodlands in the uplands and/or a return to \\nwilderness or wildness, it is very desirable to know how long it takes for native \\nbroad -leaved trees or Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) to establish themselves \\nsufficiently that regeneration  cannot be halted or reverse d by grazing animals, and \\nwhat herbivore densities allow the se successions to progress. But very few such \\nassessments have been made (Miles  et al., 1978; Marrs & Welch , 1991; Rao, 2017), \\nmainly because such successions  have been confined to a very small proportion of \\nall upland  ground  and their slowness  makes continued observation difficult and \\ncostly to sustain. Also , the time scales  estimated  for woodland establishment have \\nbeen very variable , ranging from around 10 years to more than 50 years (Marrs & \\nWelch , 1991).  \\nThe key species  affecting or c hecking successions in much British moorland is \\nCalluna vulgaris , and so most studies on moorland vegetation dynamics have \\nconcentrated on it (Legg , 1995).  The cover and height of  heather  control the \\ngraminoid and herbaceous species present (Harris  et al., 2011; Welch  & Scott , 1995) \\nand can prevent the initial establishment of tree saplings . In the former study the \\ntime scale of  heather  change was deduced by  examining c. 1000 burnt patches  2-18 \\nyears -old in five Peak District moorlands , cover and height being found to be directly \\nand closely related to the time elapsed since burning, and the cover and number of \\nsubsidiary species was inversely related to heather height.  But herbivore grazing was \\nnot assessed, tree saplings did not colonise, and the authors lame nted that “so little \\nis known about moorland post -fire succession” in Britain.  \\nLong-term monitoring  of heather  performance and tree colonisation on the Mar \\nLodge Estate in the Cairngorms is provid ing further  evidence about moorland \\nsuccessions, and is reported in th e present  paper . Partly the observations have been \\nenabled because the National Trust for Scotland, the owners of the estate since \\n1995, have had a policy of no burning in the study glens  in order to give a greater \\nfeeling of “naturalness” f or the many visitors. The monitoring began in two glens in \\n1991 following much concern about the intense pressure of high numbers of red \\ndeer ( Cervus elaphus  L.) on the estate moorlands and especially the lack of \\nregeneration of the native Caledonian pinewoods . The Mar Lodge Estate then \\ncontributed a major proportion of t he total deer in the Cairngorms and West \\nGrampian Deer Management Group , and counts by the Red Deer Commission had \\nshown a large increase in number over the previous two decades (Callander &22 \\n Mackenzie , 1991).  So there was a conservation -led demand for an assessment of \\nthis deer impact, in the hope that showing “damage” would encour age a reduction in \\nred-deer numbers.  \\nHence  base-line data about the heather state under intense grazin g was \\nobtained  in 1991 -1995 before the new ownership increased the deer cull  on most of \\nthe Mar Lodge Estate, and heather recovery  started  in Glen Derry  and Glen Lui. A \\nfirst paper (Welch et al., 2006) described the heather  trends up to spring 2001 that \\nhad resulted from the initial reduc tion in  deer grazing, and some separate \\nmonitoring of colonising pine saplings was described by Rao (2011 ; 2017 ). The \\npresent paper reports the heather  trends and tree colonisation up to 2015 in the two \\nglens on 186 plots monitored since 1991.  \\n \\nStudy areas \\nThe two study areas lay along rivers in topographic basins with high mountains \\naround . The areas  were chosen since red deer congregated in the m for much of the \\nyear and could readily be counted  there; the counts checked the validity of dung \\nassessments of presence.  \\n   \\nTable 1.

Both areas had  extensive  flat terraces  by the \\ncentral rivers , but only in Glen Derry  were these heather -dominated . The Lui \\nterraces were  mostly  grasslands lacking heather  and had been cultivated in the \\neighteenth century ; afterwards they were fertilised to maintain rich grazing for \\nlivestock.  The study  areas were largely treeless but some remnant ind ividual old \\ntrees of Scots pine grew in the southern half of the Glen Derry area; in the Glen Lui \\narea remnant old pines were even fewer and confined to the South corner . However ,23 \\n several small exclosures within and near the Lui  area had been planted with conifers \\nin the early 1970s (Scott , 1998). \\n \\n \\nFigure 1 . Position and shape of the two study areas (hatched: upper, Glen Derry; \\nlower, Glen Lui) in valleys of the Eastern Cairngorms. Arrows show direction of \\nriver flow. Surrounding peaks have altitudes given in metres. Map size is 13 x 11 \\nkm; the bottom SW corner is at NO 000890 on the British National Grid.  \\n \\nThe Glen Derry monitoring area was the higher in altitude, being both \\nupstream from Glen Lui and having steeper va lley sides. It had a greater extent of \\nwet soils, mainly peaty gleys, and drier podsols were largely confined to its steep \\neastern flank.  The peaty gleys mostly bore Erica tetralix  wet heath ( National \\nVegetation Classification ( NVC) M16; Rodwell , 1991), with local Scirpus cespitos us – \\nErica tetralix NVC M15 wet heath, and on patches of deeper peat there was Erica \\ntetralix – Sphagnum papillosum  mire NVC M18. The podsols supported Calluna \\nvulgaris – Vaccinium myrtillus  NVC H12 heath, and parts of the central alluvial \\nterraces had Nardus stricta – Galium saxatile  NVC U5 grassland. Nardus  stricta  also24 \\n was locally dominant in the far north -east corner of the Derry area  in flushed ground \\nabove the 600  m contour.  \\nThe Glen Lu i monitoring area had extensive podsols on its sloping flanks \\nbearing Calluna vulgaris – Vaccinium myrtillus  NVC H12 heath. South -west of the \\nriver there was a tract of wetter ground with peaty podsols and gleys, the vegetation \\nbeing predominately Erica te tralix wet heath NVC M16. The central alluvial \\ngrasslands lacking Calluna were not monitored  in this area .  \\nDeer were regularly fed on the  Lui riverside  grasslands in winter  until 2001 , \\nand our  counts confirmed that almost all the deer  using the Lui area  were stags , in \\nline with  the male-female  dichotomy that had long existed in this part of the Eastern \\nCairngorms . The Glen Derry area was in hind ground, and stags moved into it mostly \\nin the autumn rut.  \\nIn 1992  heather  cover was greater in Glen Lui, with mean occurrence 73% in \\nthe 8-cm diameter sampling circles as opposed to  67% in Glen Derry (Table 1) (see \\nMethods). But the  heather  was somewhat taller in Glen Derry, averaging 25 cm \\nheight as opposed to  17 cm in  Glen Lui . In Glen Derry 18% of the mo nitoring plots \\nhad heather i nitial height s greater than 30 cm  and a few plots ha d initial mean \\nheight s of 50 cm. In Glen Lui  almost half the plots had suppressed heather with \\nmean heights less than 20 cm in 1992, and 40 cm was the maximum initial height \\nthere.  \\nBurning of  heather  had formerly been the normal management practice on Mar \\nLodge Estate, but aerial photographs taken i n 1946, 1961 and 1966 indicated  its \\nfrequency was declin ing and 1989 photographs showed very little ground had been \\nburnt in the previous decade. This probably reflected m uch heather being in a \\nsuppressed state due to the rising deer population . After 1990 only a tiny section of \\nmoorland was burnt in the monitoring areas  due to an accidental fire . \\n   \\nMethods  \\nPermanent monitoring plots were set up in winter 1991 -1992 and then visited each \\nspring. The  plots were equally spaced on grids covering the whole of both \\nmonitoring areas except the riverside grasslands  in Glen Lui  (Fig. 1) . Plot size was 15 \\nx 4 m; there were 96 plots in Glen Derry and 90 in Glen Lui .  \\nThe regular monitoring was of 1) deer and lagomor ph usage and 2) heather  \\ncover, heather height and heather shoot damage from b rowsing. A dditionally , the \\nplots were assessed in the first two springs  for soil wetness (wet, moist or dry), and \\nin 1998 and 2001 the annual growth increment of  heather  was measured on 15 \\nshoots per plot. Deer usage was estimated by counting the  total number of pellet \\ngroups on the plots, and hare and rabbit usage was recorded on a 3 -point index \\nscale, dividing at mean densities of 8 and 25 pellets m-2. Assessments on heather \\ncover and shoot browsing were made using a sampling stick that had  four 8 -cm \\ndiameter circles . It was  placed at ten positions in each plot, these arranged in two \\nparallel rows along the plots lying alternately at 45°  to the  left and right of the plot \\naxis, hence 40 circles were examined per plot . All the circles were checked for the \\npresence of any green shoot of  heather  to give a  cover index, and in the first four \\ncircles with heather  present  we counted browsed and unbrowse d long shoots to give \\na measure of shoot utilisation . Mean height was estimated from c. 25 ruler measures \\nspread evenly in all the  heather  patches on a plot .25 \\n Observations on saplings of Scots pine began in 1997. When the study was \\nplanned it was not envisaged that deer numbers would be reduced sufficiently to \\nallow tree regeneration, but by 1996 this had become a management objective and \\na few sapling pines wer e seen on our plots in Glen Derry , deer numbers having \\nfallen  there. From 1998 onwards the heights of saplings were measured in Glen \\nDerry and their positions  on plots were mapped . In 2000 , systematic observations \\nwere extended to the Glen Lui plots, and any visible saplings were recorded \\nwhatever the tree species . Our counts were not an absolute count of seedlings and \\nsaplings since these are too small to be noticed within the taller heather  of most \\nplots until they are at least three or four years old ; many very young seedlings die \\ndue to competition and shading, and once bigger they suffer browsing from black \\ngrouse, lagomorphs and voles as well as  deer. Therefore the counts merely provide  \\nan index of potential tree colonisation. In later years large numbers of pine saplings \\nappeared on a h andful of plots, and then we measured only the taller ones for \\nheight.  Many plots with saplings lay close to mature Scots pines, and Chi -square \\ntests were used to assess the significance of the association.  \\nAfter 1996 yearly observations on heather cover were considered unnecessary, \\nmean values having  been found to change  little from year to year . A further cut -back \\nto reduce the time required to do the monitoring started  in 1999 , only half the plots \\nin each glen being  visited that year and in some later ones . These plots were spread  \\nacross the monitoring areas and chosen to ensure  that the mean values recorded in \\nthe reduced sampling w ere virtually identical to the means obtained on all plots. For \\nthe figures and tables reported here, heather cover and utilisation means are given \\nonly for the years when all plots were visited, but for herbivore usage means are \\ngiven for every year , the variability resulting from the reduced samplin g being \\nconsidered negligible.  \\nTo assess the impact of herbivores on heather , the study years were divided \\ninto four successive periods with progressively declining usage; end dates were \\nchosen for these periods when full sampling was available. The significances of \\nchanges in heather cover and height were assessed for each period using paired t -\\ntests that compar ed the plot data obtained in the first and last years of these \\nperiods.  For Glen Lui, the impact of the deer being fed on the central grasslands \\nuntil 2001 was assessed by assigning plots to four zones defined by distance fr om \\nthe grasslands and comparing zonal usage and heather data between  the periods \\nbefore and after 2001.  For the dung index and heather utilisation, zone year means \\nin the two periods were compared using paired t -tests; for cover and height change, \\nplot measurements obtained in the first and last years of each period were \\ncompared by paired t -tests in each zone.  \\nNomenclature follows Stace (2010) for vascular plants, Rodwell (1991) for plant \\ncommunities, and Smith (2006) for mosses.  \\n \\nResults  \\nUsage by deer  and lagomorphs  \\nUsage by deer measured from the spring counts of pellet groups fell greatly during \\nthe 24-year study period  (Fig. 2) . Number s of pellet groups  began to fall in 1995, \\nand for the next seven years usage was much less in Glen Derry  than Glen Lui. A \\nvery sharp decline between 2001 and 2002 in Glen Lui reflected not only increased \\nculling but also the cessation of winter feeding on the central grasslands; hay,26 \\n carrots or potatoes spread every day or two days in winter s till 2000 had attracted \\nmany stags which, after their feeding bout, moved onto the surrounding heather \\nmoorland.  Both red -deer and roe -deer pellet  group s contributed to the count totals, \\nbut numbers of the latter were negligible. After 2008 an intensification in the culling \\nof stags brought usage down to similar very low levels in both glens.  \\n  \\n              \\n             \\nFigure 2 . Usage by deer (upper) and lagomorphs measured in springs of 24 years \\n(1992 -2015) in the two glens.

Initially , mean utilisation was about a third less in Glen Derry than \\nGlen Lui . This  difference increased up to 2000, reflecting the divergence observed in \\ndeer numbers. In Glen L ui wet plots had much  lower  utilisation  than d rier ones, \\npartly due to deer usage but also to  rabbit  grazing; rabbits were confined to the \\ndrier parts of this glen . In Glen Derry  three of the monitoring plots were classed as \\ndry but had utilisation and deer usage no different to the moist plots, hence the se \\ntypes have been pooled  and are named moist in this paper .  \\n \\n            \\n            \\nFigure 3 .

But \\nmean heather cover was lower on the wet plots in both glens, and heather changed \\nmuch less in mean cover in Glen Derry (Fig. 4). This is reflected by the difference \\nbetween glens in the number of significant cover increases fo und for the successive \\nobservation periods defined on declining deer usage (Table 2). In Glen Derry the \\noverall 22 -year increase in the percentage of sampling circles having heather present \\nwas just 3%; this was calculated from means of 26.9 and 28.1 circl es containing \\nheather out of 40 in 1992 and 2014 respectively.

By the last years of \\nthe study many plots in Glen Lui had heather present in all 40 sampling circles, \\nlimiting the possible  increase measurable by our index.    \\n \\nTable 2.

Height increased significantly from 1992 to 2001 only in the peripheral zone to \\nthe central grasslands (> 300 m distant), and this zone  then had significantly less \\ndeer usage ( P < 0.001 ) and heather percentage shoot browsing ( P < 0.001 ) than \\nthe other three zones  (paired t -tests) .

Up to 1998 \\nthere was mostly only a single sapling on a plot and many were not found the \\nfollowing spring , hence the initial variability in the percentage of plots with saplings. \\nAfter 2001, sapling numbers increased and 7 of the 96 Derry plots had saplings \\npresent throughout the rest of the study, though few further plots were colonised. \\nBy 2015 there were 95 saplings on 11 plots. Most of the 18 plots that at some time \\nhad saplings were at the south end of the Glen Derry area close to tall old pi nes: 11 \\nof the 18 lay within 50 m of old pines and almost all the post -2001 increase in \\nsapling number was on them. The association of sapling presence on plots and old \\npines being < 50 m distant was highly significant (Chi -sq = 16.8, P < 0.001), and \\nplots situated > 50 m from old pines contributed very little to the sapling total \\nhaving at most 2 saplings present in any recording.   \\nIn Glen Lui pine saplings were observed only twice on monitoring plots before \\n2008 (Fig. 6). Then steady colonisation began o n two plots and by 2014 these plots \\ncontributed 206 out of the 238 total saplings. The two plots lay within 20 m of \\nexclosures planted with pines and other conifers in 1971, and another four plots on \\nwhich saplings appeared in 2009 -2011 were less than 50 m  distant to mature pines \\nproducing cones; the association of sapling presence on plots with mature pines \\nbeing < 50 m distant was highly significant (Chi -sq = 11.2 P < 0.001), as in Glen \\nDerry. However, 11 of the 19 plots situated inside this 50 m radius z one were never \\nfound to have saplings.  \\nThe heights of the saplings increased only very slowly in Glen Derry, due to \\nregular browsing. By 2009, the average of top heights on all plots with saplings had \\nonly reached 14.1 cm, a rise of 0.5 cm since 1998 (Fig . 7). The year means came \\nfrom 11 plots, but due to sapling deaths and new occurrences only 6 plots were \\ncommon to 1998 and 2009. From 2009 to 2015 the same 11 plots kept saplings and \\nmean top plot heights rose by 8.5 cm. The turnover of saplings meant ver y few \\nindividuals were recorded for more than ten years, but the 6 saplings on 4 separate \\nplots present for 11 years from 2003 had mean heights of 14.7 cm (2003), 14.8 cm \\n(2006), 16.0 cm (2009), 18.2 cm (2012) and 20.0 cm (2014). Setbacks to height \\nincreme nt due to browsing were fewer in later years. However, the top tree of all \\nGlen Derry plots early in the study, that had reached 52 cm height by 2006, was \\nthen thrashed by roe deer, and was dead in 2008, causing the sharp drop that year \\nin top heights (Fig . 7). \\nIn Glen Lui the top saplings gained height steadily (Fig. 7). All but one of those \\nappearing in 2008 -2010 were on plots classed as dry, and their annual increments \\nwere greater than those of the Glen Derry saplings. Because many new saplings \\nappeared  each year once colonisation began in this glen, mean plot heights showed \\nlittle increase, and so give a poorer measure than the top heights of the time needed \\nto produce definite tree colonisation not liable to be stopped by deer. The tallest Lui \\nsapling,  57 cm tall in 2015, is not likely to have reached for at least six more years \\nsufficient height to be safe from thrashing or from browsing when snow is deep.33 \\n              \\n             \\nFigure 6 .

On wet soils that \\nmainly carried NVC M15 Scirpus cespitosus – Erica tetralix   heath, the increase in the \\ncover of C. vulgaris  was much less pronounced, and with presence in only 55 -60% \\nof the 8 -cm sampling circles (Fig. 4) there was much space remaining for E. tetralix  \\nto flourish; presence in a circle did not mean that a species occupied the whole \\ncircle; had we recorded E. tetralix  in the monitoring it would have had at least as \\ngreat a n occurrence in circles as Calluna  on these wet plots.

The heather bushes on these \\nwet plots did gain height (Fig. 5) but many are old and moribund, and had few \\nlateral shoots, so there seems little prospect of succession in this community.  \\n  \\n           \\n           \\nFigure 7 .

Broom is \\nlimited to low altitudes in Britain , rarely occurring above 600 m  (Preston, Pearman & \\nDines , 2002) , and dieback results from low winter tempera tures (Peterson & Prasad , \\n1998). So succession to broom dominance in Glen Lui therefore seems unlikely.   \\nThe heather  itself is susceptible to winter die -back; this follow s desiccation due \\nto continued transpiration  when the ground is deeply frozen (Watson et al., 1966). \\nDie-back has been shown to vary considerably between years on neighbouring \\nmoorland (Moss & Miller , 1976), and a major die -back event was observed at \\nAbernethy 20 km north of Glen Derry  in spring 2003  (Hancock , 2008).  Limited \\nheather browning and die -back was seen in most springs in our Mar Lodge \\nmonitoring, but we did not measure it  and in 2003 only obtained estimates of \\nheather cover in Glen Lui.  However , in spring 2004 heather was noted as being in \\n“poor condition”  on some plots, and between 2003 and 2005 there was a decline in \\nthe cover index on wet plots (Fig. 4). At Abernethy die -back was more severe on \\nflatter ground and where heather had less cover (Hancock , 2008), conditions that \\napply to our wet plots . So die -back as well as selective grazing, poor growth and old \\nage may contribute to the observed lower overall cover gains on our wet plots ; there \\nwas actually cover loss on the Lui  wet plots from 2001 to 2007 (Table 2) unexpected \\nin view of the low deer usage, and still in 2013 the cover index was lower than in \\n1998 to 2003 for them (Fig. 4).  \\nColonisation by sapling Scots pines has started in both Glen Derry and Glen Lui \\nbut is currently limited to a very few plots and a considerable further period of \\nnegligible  browsing from deer will be  necessary for it to succeed.  Almost all the \\nsaplings observed occur within 50 m of coning  pines but plots inside this limit \\ncomprise less than a fifth of the overall number monitored (Table 1). One of the two \\nGlen Lui plots with many saplings l ies just 15 m from a plantation of 1971 , fitting \\nwith observations in the nearby Ballochbuie pinewood that saplings were most \\nnumerous within 20 m of seed so urces (Scott et al., 2000). Also important in \\nsignificantly explaining sapling number at Ballochbuie was low heather height, and \\nsimilarly  in the  Northern  Cairngorms French et al. (1997) found pine establishment \\non moorland to be greatest when sward  height was less than 20 cm. In the present \\nstudy  there was a similar finding for Glen Lui: the two plots with many saplings had \\nmean heather height of just 10 cm in 2010, and three more of the seven plots  then \\nwith such low height experienced  colonisation.  In Glen Derry plots within 50 m of \\nseed sources had taller heather (mean height 30 cm in 2008 ), which may well have \\ncontribute d to the sapling numbers being lower there than in Glen Lui.  \\nThe trends  in plot sapling top  heights (Fig. 7) give a rough indication of how \\nlong it will take for the pine saplings to reach a height  safe from deer damage ; we \\njudge  this height  to be about 180 cm , allowing for deep snow and trunks being \\nstrong and thick enough to deter , or survive  from, thrashing or bark stripping by \\ndeer. In Glen Lui , plot top heights rose by 1 4 cm in the two years from 2013, and \\nfrom our continuing measurements on the Ballochbuie saplings, annual increments \\ncould rise to average 20 cm once the Glen Lui saplings re ach 1 m height. This means \\nit will take , on average,  another eight years for the 14 plots currently with sapling s36 \\n to have at least one tree reaching safety, and rather less time on the plots with best \\ngrowth.  In Glen Derry , top heights have gained by only about 1 cm a year since \\n2010, reflecting the much poorer growing conditions on wet soils at higher altitudes, \\nand doubtless  it will take decades there for regeneration to occur away from \\nfavourable drier situations.  Small mean annual increments  of saplings have also \\nbeen found by Rao (2017)  on plots next to  mature pines stands  on Mar Lodge ; \\nincrements  varied between her study areas but have much increased since 2008. \\nSo a conjunction of at least four circumstances and factors is needed for \\nsuccessful pine colonisation at mid altitudes in the Cairngorms: (1) very low grazing \\npressure, (2) adult coning trees within 50 m, (3) heather sward s of less height than \\n20 cm, and (4) soils not wet. Although a quarter of the Glen Derry plots and nearly \\nhalf the Glen Lui plots had heather height less than 20 cm when the study began \\n(Table 1), by the time that red -deer numbers had fallen suitably low ( c. 2002 in Glen \\nDerry and c. 2009 in Glen Lui), these plots comprised just 3% and 19% of the total \\npresent in the respective study areas. And in Glen Lui only 9 of these 17 plots with \\nlow heather lay within 50 m of pine seed sources.    \\nThe National Trust for Scotland in their management p lanning (2012) recognise \\nthe need for more ground to be made suitable for pine establishment  in both Glen \\nDerry and Glen Lui, and have considered scarification and heather burning as ways \\nof achieving this.  Both will reduce the perception of naturalness for visitors, but \\nheather burning is a very controversial issue at present (Davies  et al., 2016), and is \\nlikely to be held back until experiments with scarification have started; the 2012 plan \\nsays “burning will be explored during the first few years” of i ntervention work.  We \\nconsider that small -scale burning around old ancient pines limited to 20 -30 m radius \\nfrom the trees would  be acceptable and successful , and suggest that a suitable area \\nfor this to be tested is at the south extremity of the Glen Lui ar ea where the soils are \\ndry. \\nOnce patches of regenerated pine trees have been achieved they are likely to  \\ngive places where red deer can feed, rest and shelter, and control of deer there will \\nbe more difficult than in the present open moorland and remnant stands of old \\npinewood. This should not be considered bad since the deer will regularly emerge \\nand feed i n the surrounding heather -dominated moorland.  Hence  these areas will \\nstay open, still giving visitors attractive views of the surrounding landscape with high \\nmountains.  This will ensure that delights for the many (Morgan -Davies  et al., 2015) \\nwill have been combined with satisfaction to conservationists due to  the Scots pine \\nwoodland  that they greatly value having  a safe future on the Mar Lodge  Estate . \\nA drawback of the very light grazing needed to achieve regeneration of the \\nScots pinewo ods is that this has allowed the heather to grow much taller especially \\non drier soils, and the risk of serious fires has increased.  Tall heather now extends \\nacross a m uch larger block of ground than our two study areas, and it would be \\ndifficult and costly to reduce fire risk by creating firebreaks within this ground.  \\nThis study has ended in its present form, but several elements could usefully \\nbe continued to better give answers about the time scale for vegetation change and \\npinewood colonisation in Cairngorm glens and moorland. The NVC M15 Scirpus \\ncespitosus – Erica tetralix  wet heath might  develop into a Calluna -dominated \\ncommunity akin to H12 with scarce E. tetralix  if the heather were to increase in \\ncover following its recent height increase; this  possibility is suggested by stands of \\nthese two types alternating on the west side of Glen Derry . They occur on what37 \\n seem similar soils, and possibly the M15 areas are the result of fires decades ago \\nfrom which Calluna has recovered much more slowly than Erica tetralix . The possible \\ncolonisation of Cytisus scoparius  on the dry south -facing slopes of Glen Lui should \\nalso be monitored with specific measurements on its cover.  These warmer slopes on \\nrelatively rich soils should also be watched for the possibl e colonisation of deciduous \\ntrees, rowan ( Sorbus aucuparia ) being the most likely. But most important is further \\nmonitoring is to gain more knowledge on the time scale for Scots pine saplings to \\nreach a safe height from deer damage, and about the plot cond itions that allow pine \\nseedlings to colonise within the 50 m range of pine seed sources. For this , our \\nexisting plots could be utilised and extra ones set up.  \\n \\nAcknowledgements  \\nToo many people have helped in a study lasting 25 years to be named individually , \\nbut we are grateful to them all.

Present study was undertaken tore-assess the performance of drought tolerant (PRLT 2/89-33) and drought sensitive (H 77/833-2) parentsalong with two QTL-NILs (ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01040), under salinity stress speciﬁcally imposed duringpost-ﬂowering growth stages when plants had developed their ion sinks in full. Time course changes inionic accumulation and their compartmentalization in different plant parts was studied, speciﬁcally tomonitor and capture changes conferred by the two alleles at this QTL, at small intervals. Amongst differentplant parts, higher accumulation of toxic ion Na\\n+was recorded in roots. Further, the Na+concentration\\nin roots of the testcross hybrid of the drought-sensitive parent (H 77/833-2) reached its maximum atECiw 15 dS m\\n−1within 24 h after salinity imposition, whereas it continued to increase with time in the\\ntestcross hybrids of the drought tolerant parent PRLT 2/89-33 as well as those of its QTL-NILs (ICMR 01029and ICMR 01004) and reached at its maximum at 120 h stage. Comparison of differential distribution oftoxic ions in individual leaves revealed that Na\\n+ions were not uniformly distributed in the leaves of\\nthe drought-tolerant parent and drought-tolerant QTL-NILs; but accumulated preferentially in the olderleaves, whereas the hybrid of the drought-sensitive parent showed signiﬁcantly higher Na\\n+concentra-\\ntion in all main stem leaves irrespective of their age. Dynamics of chlorophyll and proline concentrationvariation studied under salt stress at late ﬂowering stages revealed a greater reduction, almost twice, inboth leaf chlorophyll and proline concentrations in younger leaves in the hybrids of the sensitive parentas compared to the tolerant parent and QTL NILs. Imposition of salinity stress even at ﬂowering stageaffected the yield performance in pearl millet, wherein higher yield was recorded in drought tolerantparent and the two QTL-NILs compared to drought sensitive parent.\\n© 2014 The Authors.

In these regions, it is predominantlygrown as a rainfed crop and severe droughts occur due to scantyand untimely rains during the cropping season. The crop partic-ularly experiences drought stress during post-ﬂowering growth.Apart from drought, areas where pearl millet is grown are oftencharacterised by saline underground waters. In times of severedrought, such brackish ground water is typically the only irrigationoption that can save the dying crop.\\nGenetic mapping studies in pearl millet have identiﬁed a major\\nquantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with maintenance of com-ponents of grain and stover yield under terminal drought stressconditions ( Yadav et al., 2002, 2004; Bidinger et al., 2007 ), and evi-\\ndence of constitutive differences in leaf abscisic acid concentrationresulting in reduced transpiration rates in genotypes having thedrought tolerance alleles at this QTL has been reported ( Kholová\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2014.01.013\\n0098-8472/© 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/ ).P.C. Sharma et al. / Environmental and Experimental Botany 102 (2014) 48–57 49\\net al., 2010a,b ). Recently, we have established that the drought-\\ntolerance allele at this QTL also contributes to better performanceunder salinity and alkalinity stress conditions ( Sharma et al., 2011 ).\\nTestcross hybrids of the QTL donor parent (drought-tolerant PRLT2/89-33), QTL recipient parent (drought-sensitive H 77/833-2), anda set of six near-isogenic lines (NILs) derived by marker-assistedbackcross introgression into H 77/833-2 background of donor par-ent alleles in the vicinity of the terminal drought tolerance (DT)QTL (QTL-NILs) were evaluated at germination, vegetative andmaturity stages under three salinity and alkalinity levels in thatstudy ( Sharma et al., 2011 ). It was revealed that the DT-QTL alleles\\ncontributed by donor PRLT 2/89-33 exerted favourable effects ongrowth and productivity traits under conditions of salt stress rightfrom the seedling stage through to maturity, by better compart-mentalization of Na\\n+in nodes and internodes besides limiting Na+\\naccumulation in leaves.\\nDuring germination and emergence, tolerance is based on\\npercent survival, while during the later developmental stages,tolerance results from a complex interaction of multitude ofadaptation strategies involving compartmentation of toxic ions,accumulation of osmolytes and conservation of water. There-fore, the present study was undertaken to gain deeper insightsof the effects of alleles of this DT QTL under salt stress speciﬁ-cally when the stress is applied at ﬂowering and post-ﬂoweringgrowth stages and to better understand the mechanism of salinetolerance conferred by this major QTL at late ﬂowering stages.Drought-tolerant and -sensitive parents, and the two QTL-NILs(ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01040) differing for the drought toleranceQTL ( Yadav et al., 2002, 2011 ), were evaluated under post-ﬂowering\\nsalt stress conditions by imposing salinity treatments beginning at45 days after crop emergence, when ﬂowering has almost com-pleted and the plant sink is fully developed. Ionic accumulation andcompartmentalization was quantiﬁed in different plant parts as afunction of time after imposition of the stress, speciﬁcally to mon-itor and capture changes at small intervals during post-ﬂoweringgrowth conferred by two alleles at this QTL in fully developed ionsinks.\\nThe synthesis and accumulation of compatible osmolytes such\\nas proline has been reported widely as a metabolic response tomaintain osmotic pressure under salt and water stress in manyplant species ( Ramanjulu and Sudhakar, 2000; deLacerda et al.,\\n2003; Demiral and Türkan, 2005; Desingh and Kanagaraj, 2007;Koca et al., 2007; Sneha et al., 2013 ). In addition to its role as a\\ncytosolic osmolyte, proline also serves as a sink for energy to reg-ulate redox potentials, as a hydroxyl radical scavenger, and as asolute that protects macromolecules against denaturation ( Blum\\nand Ebercon, 1976; Simiroff and Cumbes, 1989; Venkamp et al.,1989 ). Therefore, besides ionic analysis, proline and chlorophyll\\nconcentrations were also assessed in individual leaves of the exper-imental materials used in this study to investigate whether theconcomitant changes, if any, occurring in their levels under salinitystress is associated with salinity tolerance.\\n2. Materials and methods\\n2.1. Plant material\\nPlant material chosen was essentially the same as described\\ninSharma et al. (2011) and Kholová et al. (2010a,b) . Testcross\\nhybrids of two parental genotypes, PRLT 2/89-33 (drought-tolerant,donor parent for drought tolerance QTL) and H 77/833-2 (drought-sensitive, recipient parent for drought tolerance QTL), and twoQTL-NILs (ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01040) were used in the detailedinvestigations reported in this study.2.2. Plant growth and salinity stress treatments\\nTen replicates of each genotype were sown directly in 20 kg\\ncapacity ceramic pots ﬁlled with sand. Initially, 15 seeds were sownin each pot. Emerged seedlings were thinned to three seedlings perpot 15 days after sowing (DAS). These plants were allowed to growunder normal conditions up to 45 DAS in a net house at the Cen-tral Soil Salinity Research Institute (CSSRI), Karnal, Haryana, India,from June to September, 2009, when natural growing conditions(temperature 25–35\\n◦C, relative humidity 60–82%) are generally\\nfavourable for pearl millet growth and development. During thisperiod, plants received irrigation daily with ¼ strength Hoaglandnutrient solution.\\nAt 45 DAS, salinity stress was initiated to study salt relations of\\nthese genotypes as a function of time at a stage when they have fullydeveloped their sink capacity under non-stress conditions. Thiswould permit study of salt uptake by the plants as well as of theircompartmentalization ability of the toxic ions in the already devel-oped and fully-expanded tissues/sink over time when confrontedwith salinity stress. At this stage, pots were divided into threesets: one set of plants received irrigation of ECiw 2.0 dS m\\n−1, while\\nthe other two received irrigation of ECiw 10.0 and 15.0 dS m−1,\\nrespectively. The saline water for irrigation was prepared by addingNaCl, Na\\n2SO4and CaCl 2, keeping Na:Ca and Cl:SO 4ratios of 4:1\\nin ¼ strength Hoagland nutrient solution as described in Sharma\\net al. (2011) . The pots were irrigated daily so as to maintain the\\nrespective salinity level in the root zone. Plants were sampleddestructively at the time of initiation of salinity stress treatments(zero hour) and thereafter at 24, 48 and 120 h following initialimposition of the salinity stress treatments.\\n2.3. Measurement of chlorophyll, proline, ion concentrations and\\nyield related parameters\\nAt each sampling, the plants were separated into stem, root and\\nthe individual leaves. For the sake of uniformity, eight leaves weresampled from each plant with basal leaf labelled as 1 and topmostleaf on the main stem as 8. The individual leaves were excisedfrom the main stem to record chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and totalchlorophyll by extraction in 80% ethanol. For measuring chloro-phyll, the extract absorbance was measured at 642 and 665 nmon a spectrophotometer and chlorophyll concentrations were cal-culated according to Arnon (1949) . Required amounts of 300 mM\\nglacial acetic acid were subsequently added to the same solutionto make ﬁnal concentrations 100 mM. The tissue was re-extractedfor 2 h at 90\\n◦C for the determination of Na+and K+concentrations\\nof the individual leaves as described in Yeo and Flowers (1983) .\\nThe ionic concentrations were also determined from main stemand root samples following wet digestion, using ﬂame spectropho-tometery as described by Sharma et al. (2011) . Four replications\\nwere used for measuring ion concentrations, which were calcu-lated as mmol g\\n−1fresh weight in case of leaves and as mmol g−1\\ndry weight in case of stem and root samples. The salinity-induced\\nchanges in proline concentrations were also recorded in differentleaves following Bates et al. (1973) .\\nSaline irrigation continued in the remaining six replications\\nuntil harvest of the crop for recording yield and yield-relatedparameters. At maturity, three plants per pot were harvested andair dried prior to recording their biomass, stover and grain yieldsas described in Yadav et al. (2002, 2004) .\\n2.4.

Genotype ×salinity ×time-course treatment interac-\\ntions were also analysed.\\n3. Results\\n3.1. Ionic accumulation in different plant parts\\nSigniﬁcant genotypic differences in ion accumulations were evi-\\ndent amongst the two parental genotypes and two QTL-NILs in allthe three plant parts ( viz.main stem, roots and leaves) in the salin-\\nity treatments and the time-course of salinity treatments appliedin this study ( Fig. 1 ).\\nTwenty-four hour after imposition of salinity stress, maximum\\nNa\\n+accumulation was recorded in roots ( Fig. 1 B) followed by\\nthe main stem ( Fig. 1 C) and leaves ( Fig. 1 D). Na+accumulation\\nincreased continuously in these plant parts with the time-courseof salinity treatments, from imposition until 120 h, both in parentalgenotypes as well as the two QTL-NILs. The salinity-sensitive par-ent H 77/833-2 recorded highest concentration of Na\\n+in roots as\\nquickly as 24 h of salinity stress imposition of ECiw 15 dS m−1and\\nthis Na+level did not increase signiﬁcantly thereafter ( Fig. 1 B). On\\nthe other hand, Na+concentration in roots of the tolerant parent\\nPRLT 2/89-33 and the QTL-NILs (ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01040)reached a lower level 24 h after imposition of the salinity stresstreatments and then continued to increase throughout the 120 htime-course.\\nNa\\n+concentrations in main stems increased both with time and\\nsalinity levels and a marked contrast was notable between testcrossgenotypes at 120 h, in the ECiw 15 dS m\\n−1treatment ( Fig. 1 C). At\\nthis salinity level, H 77/833-2 accumulated signiﬁcantly higher Na+\\nin its stems (0.99 mmol g−1dry wt) compared to PRLT 2/89-33\\n(0.67 mmol g−1dry wt). Compared to levels at the initiation of salin-\\nity stress (0.16 and 0.18 mmol g−1dry wt in sensitive and tolerant\\nparents, respectively), Na+levels in stems increased by more than\\n6-fold in the sensitive parent and around 3.7-fold in the tolerantparent. Similar to PRLT 2/89-33, the two QTL-NILs also accumulated\\nlower amounts of Na+in their main stems than H 77/833-2 ( Fig. 1 C).\\nAt 120 h after salinity treatment imposition at ECiw 15 dS m−1, the\\nmean Na+concentration in stems of H 77/833-2 was 32% higher\\nthan PRLT 2/89-33. Further, the Na/K ratio in stems of H 77/833-2,120 h after imposition of the salinity treatment of 15 dS m\\n−1, was\\n6.7 times of the value at zero h; whereas this ratio increased by 3.6and 4.9 times, in PRLT 2/89-33 and QTL-NILs, respectively.\\nIn strong contrast to roots ( Fig. 1 B) and main stems ( Fig. 1 C),\\nleaves recorded lower Na\\n+concentrations ( Fig. 1 D). Signiﬁcant\\ndifferences in Na+accumulation started to appear in leaves of\\nthe parental genotypes and the QTL-NILs at 24 and 48 h into thetime-course at ECiw 10 dS m\\n−1. However, at ECiw 15 dS m−1, non-\\nsigniﬁcant differences were observed in Na+concentration across\\nall genotypes at 24 and 48 h. It was only after 120 h that Na+accu-\\nmulation started to differ signiﬁcantly between the two parentsas H 77/833-2 and PRLT 2/89-33 had accumulated 2.2 and 1.3times more Na\\n+than at the 24 and 48 h harvests, respectively. The\\ntwo QTL-NILs, however, did not show any signiﬁcant differences inNa\\n+concentrations when harvested 24, 48 and 120 h after salinity\\nimposition at ECiw 15 dS m−1. Further, H 77/833-2 had accumu-\\nlated almost double Na+than PRLT 2/89-33 and more than two\\ntimes the QTL NILs ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01040 at 120 h aftersalinity imposition of EC 15 dS m\\n−1. Further, at the same stage and\\nsalinity level, Na/K ratio in leaves of the sensitive parent increasedto 1.9 times that of the tolerant parent and of the two QTL-NILs.\\n3.2. Ionic accumulation in individual leaves\\nSigniﬁcant differences in leaf Na\\n+concentration were evi-\\ndent across leaves, genotypes and salinity levels ( Fig. 2 ). At 24 h\\nafter initial imposition of stress, H 77/833-2 accumulated 11%higher Na\\n+concentration than PRLT 2/89-33, and the difference\\nfurther increased to 29% by 120 h after salinity treatment impo-sition. Further, the two QTL-NILs, ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01040,P.C. Sharma et al. / Environmental and Experimental Botany 102 (2014) 48–57 51\\nFig. 2.

The sensitive parent H77/833-2 accumulated higher Na\\n+levels, regardless of leaf posi-\\ntion, ( Fig. 2 A) than PRLT 2/89-33 ( Fig. 2 B) with increasing intensities\\nand durations of salinity stress. All the leaves of the two QTL-NILsshowed lower Na\\n+concentrations than did comparable leaves of\\neither of the two parental genotypes ( Fig. 2 ). The same trend of\\nNa+accumulation continued in different leaves 48 h after salin-\\nity imposition in the two parental genotypes as well as in the twoQTL-NILs. The most signiﬁcant observation at ECiw 10 dS m\\n−1was\\nthat the oldest leaf (leaf position 1) of PRLT 2/89-33 started toshow increased accumulation of Na\\n+after 48 h (0.32 mM) as com-\\npared to the oldest leaf of H 77/833-2 (0.23 mM). Under the samesalinity level (ECiw 10 dS m\\n−1) at 120 h harvest, signiﬁcant differ-\\nences in Na+accumulation were observed amongst the different\\ngenotypes studied. The Na+concentration of leaves continued to\\nincrease with time through 120 h at ECiw 15 dS m−1in all four\\ngenotypes evaluated. Na+concentration in the lowermost leaf was\\nhigher in PRLT 2/89-33, 24 and 48 h after salinity stress impositionthan in the comparable leaf of H 77/833-2; however, no signiﬁ-cant differences were observed in the remaining leaves. Further,signiﬁcant differences between leaf Na\\n+concentrations of the four\\ngenotypes were observed 120 h after imposition of ECiw 15 dS m−1\\nsalinity stress. The leaves at positions 1 to 7 in H 77/833-2 ( Fig. 2 A)\\nshowed two times greater Na+concentrations than did comparable\\nleaves of PRLT 2/89-33 ( Fig. 2 B). Comparison of older and younger\\nleaves in these genotypes revealed that the lowermost three leaves(leaves at position 1, 2, 3) of PRLT 2/89-33 and the QTL-NILs showedsigniﬁcantly higher Na\\n+concentrations than the uppermost ﬁve\\nleaves (leaves at position 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), whereas H 77/833-2 consis-tently showed signiﬁcantly higher Na\\n+concentrations in all leaves,\\nirrespective of their age or position ( Fig. 2 ).\\nRate of Na+accumulation in different leaves also differed\\namongst tolerant and sensitive parents as well as the QTL-NILs. Na+\\naccumulation was more rapid during the ﬁrst 24 h following salin-ity treatment imposition and slowed thereafter in all genotypes,at ECiw 10 and 15 dS m\\n−1salinity levels. Genotypes H 77/833-2\\nand PRLT 2/89-33 did not differ in their rate of Na+accumulation\\nin different leaves at ECiw 10 dS m−1. However, such differences\\nappeared with increase in salinity level to ECiw 15 dS m−1. Dur-\\ning the ﬁrst 24 h of salinity stress at ECiw15 dS m−1, both H\\n77/833-2 and PRLT 2/89-33 accumulated Na+in leaves at rates of\\n7-11 mmol g−1leaf fresh weight per hour in the basal leaves and\\n2-5 mmol g−1leaf fresh weight per hour in topmost leaves. Though\\nthis rate of Na+accumulation slowed a bit in H 77/833-2 beyond\\n24 h, a drastic reduction was recorded in PRLT 2/89-33. In the basalleaves of H 77/833-2, the rate of Na\\n+accumulation reduced from\\n11 mmol g−1leaf fresh weight per hour (0–24 h) to 8 mmol g−1leaf\\nfresh weight per hour during 48–120 h following salinity stressimposition, respectively. The comparable decline in PRLT 2/89-33was from 11 to 1 mmol g\\n−1leaf fresh weight per hour during these\\nsame intervals. Rate of Na+accumulation in different leaves of the\\ntwo QTL-NILs fell between the ranges of their donor and recurrentparents.\\nThe Na/K ratio behaved in a similar fashion in different geno-\\ntypes with respect to salinity levels, time intervals and leafpositions. This ratio declined with increase in leaf position frombase to top. In H 77/833-2, the basal leaf showed 79% higher Na/Kthan the topmost leaf 120 h after imposition of salinity stress atECiw 15 dS m\\n−1, whereas, the similar increase in PRLT 2/89-33 and\\nthe two QTL-NILs was around 56% and 69% respectively ( Table 1 ).52 P.C.

Chlorophyll concentration in leaves\\nSigniﬁcant differences in total chlorophyll concentration were\\nobserved with respect to genotypes, salinity levels, leaf position andtheir interactions 24, 48 and 120 h after initial salinity stress impo-sition (\\nFig. 3 ). The sensitive parent recorded higher total chlorophyll\\n(mg g−1fresh weight) concentration value (1.60) than the tolerant\\nparent (1.48) on an overall mean basis (means of salinity level, timeperiod and individual leaves), whereas the two QTL-NILs recordedtotal chlorophyll concentration values of 1.22 (ICMR 01029) and1.13 (ICMR 01040), respectively. At the start of salinity stress impo-sition (0 h), all leaves at different positions recorded higher totalchlorophyll concentration values in H 77/833-2 (+47% basal leafand +10% top leaf) ( Fig. 3 A) than PRLT 2/89-33 ( Fig. 3 B) or those of\\nthe QTL-NILs (+58% basal leaf and +53% top leaf) ( Fig. 3 C, 3D). How-\\never, there was greater reduction of total chlorophyll concentrationin leaves of H 77/833-2 under salinity stress (ECiw 15 dS m\\n−1)2 4h\\nlater, as chlorophyll concentration values were then similar in thetwo parental genotypes. Further, at ECiw 15 dS m\\n−1, leaf chloro-\\nphyll concentrations were much lower in H 77/833-2 ( −75% in basal\\nleaf and −40% on top leaf) than in QTL-NIL ICMR 01029. Similarly,\\nthe QTL-NIL ICMR 01040 also showed higher chlorophyll than H77/833-2 at the higher salinity level (+21% for basal leaf and +19%for top most leaf). At ECiw 15 dS m\\n−1, the mean chlorophyll concen-\\ntrations declined by 28 and 10% in H 77/833-2 and PRLT 2/89-33respectively, compared to their controls. In contrast, it increased by30 (ICMR 01040) to 39% (ICMR 01029) in the QTL-NILs. Further, thetotal chlorophyll concentrations increased in different leaves frombase to top in all the genotypes ( Fig. 3 ).\\nAccumulation of Na\\n+also affected chlorophyll concentration in\\nleaves. Tissue tolerance (measured as the leaf Na+concentration at\\nwhich 50% loss of chlorophyll occurred) varied amongst genotypesand across time intervals after salinity stress imposition. At ECiw15 dS m\\n−1, 50% loss of chlorophyll occurred at Na+concentration\\nof 0.34 mmol g−1fresh weight in leaves of H 77/833-2, whereas\\nsimilar loss occurred at Na+concentration of 0.40 mmol g−1fresh\\nweight in PRLT 2/89-33 after 24 h of salinity stress (data not shown).The same trend was also observed after 48 and 120 h of salinity\\nstress. The tissue tolerance values were 0.38 and 0.54 mmol g−1\\nfresh weight in H 77/833-2 and PRLT 2/89-33 respectively, after\\n48 h of stress imposition. The tissue tolerance values were alsocomputed from earlier experiment ( Sharma et al., 2011 ) under\\nlong-term salt stress, in which plants were raised under salinitystress from germination stage onwards. In leaves of H 77/833-2, Na\\n+concentration required for 50% loss of chlorophyll was\\n0.12 mmol g−1fresh weight, whereas similar loss in chlorophyll\\nrequired 0.16 mmol Na+g−1fresh weight in PRLT 2/89-33 ( Fig. 4 A).\\nSimilarly, the two QTL-NILs required 0.14 (ICMR 01029) and 0.15(ICMR 01040) mmol g\\n−1fresh weight leaf Na+, to cause 50% chloro-\\nphyll loss.\\n3.4. Proline concentrations in leaves\\nLeaf proline concentration increased with increase in salinity\\nlevel and duration of salinity stress in all the genotypes evaluated.Signiﬁcant differences in proline concentrations were recordedfor the four genotypes in harvests made at zero and 24 h aftersalinity imposition, whereas at 48 and 120 h, non-signiﬁcant differ-ences were recorded ( Fig. 5 ). Further, signiﬁcant differences were\\nobserved for both salinity treatments (ECiw 10 and 15 dS m\\n−1)a t\\nharvests taken 24, 48 and 120 h after salinity imposition. Com-pared to the zero h harvest, after 120 h of salinity stress at ECiw15 dS m\\n−1, the mean proline concentration (mean of individual\\nleaves) had increased by 52% in H 77/833-2, whereas the com-parable increase was 87% in PRLT 2/89-33. Further, PRLT 2/89-33showed 22% higher proline concentration in different leaves (onmean basis) than H 77/833-2 120 h after imposition of the ECiw15 dS m\\n−1salinity treatment. Similarly, the two QTL-NILs recorded\\n19 (ICMR 01029) and 14% (ICMR 01040) higher leaf proline concen-trations than H 77/833-2 120 h after imposition of this treatment.Comparison of proline concentrations in individual leaves revealedhigher proline levels in younger leaves than in older leaves as salin-ity stress increased. Genotype PRLT 2/89-33 showed almost twicethe proline concentration in younger leaves at 48 and 120 h afterimposition of salinity stress than H 77/833-2, at both salinity levels(ECiw 10 and 15 dS m\\n−1, data not shown). The QTL-NILs, however,\\ndid not show any discernible patterns for proline distribution inindividual leaves.P.C. Sharma et al. / Environmental and Experimental Botany 102 (2014) 48–57 53\\nFig. 3.

Stover and seed yield\\nInterestingly, the imposition of salinity even at ﬂowering stage\\n(45 DAS) affected the pearl millet yield performance. Under controlconditions (ECiw 2 dS m\\n−1), H 77/833-2 recorded highest stover\\nyield ( Fig. 6 ). Signiﬁcant genotypic differences were evident for\\nboth stover and grain yield under salinity stress on per plant aswell as on per pot basis. Compared to the control (ECiw 2 dS m\\n−1),\\nstover yield at ECiw 15 dS m−1declined by 65% in H 77/833-2 and\\nby 44% in PRLT 2/89-33. This decline in the two QTL-NILs was 37%(ICMR 01029) and 52% (ICMR 01040), respectively. Compared to H77/833-2, PRLT 2/89-33 recorded 57% higher stover yield at ECiw15 dS m\\n−1. Further, the two QTL-NILs showed 60% (ICMR 01029)\\nand 21% (ICMR 01040) higher stover yield than H 77/833-2 at ECiw15 dS m\\n−1. Similar trend was also observed for grain yield. Geno-\\ntype PRLT 2/89-33 showed 32% higher grain yield (per plant) thanH 77/833-2 at ECiw 15 dS m\\n−1(Fig. 6 ). Similarly, the two QTL-NILs\\n(ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01040) recorded 32 and 33% higher grainyield, respectively, than H 77/833-2 at ECiw 15 dS m\\n−1.\\n4. Discussion\\nWe have shown previously that the major terminal drought\\ntolerance (DT) QTL on pearl millet linkage group 2 (LG 2) exertsfavourable effects on growth of drought-tolerant parent PRLT2/89-33 and its QTL-NILs (introgressed with the LG 2 DT-QTLfrom drought-tolerant parent PRLT 2/89-33) right from germina-tion and seedling emergence through to maturity under varyingsalinity and alkalinity stress conditions as well, by limiting Na\\n+\\naccumulation in leaves and by partitioning these into nodes andinternodes of the stem ( Sharma et al., 2011 ). Further, it has been\\ndemonstrated that the drought-tolerant parent allele of this QTLis associated with constitutively increased leaf ABA concentration(Kholová et al., 2010a ) and reduced transpiration rates ( Kholová\\net al., 2010b ). The focus of our present study was to improve\\nour understanding of how the tolerant parent allele cope withhigh salt stress, particularly when applied at reproductive growthstages. For this, we have imposed more severe salt stress (ECiw15 dS m\\n−1) than before (up to ECiw 12 dS m−1,Sharma et al.,\\n2011 ), during late ﬂowering and post-ﬂowering growth stages\\nfollowing development of sink strength on main stem panicles,and studied the time course of changes in ion accumulation indifferent ion sinks (individual leaves, main stem and roots), toassess the differences in ion uptake and distribution in differentplant parts and on yield parameters. We also focused on under-standing the dynamics of chlorophyll and proline concentrationvariation, if any, associated with this DT-QTL under salt stress at\\nlate ﬂowering stages.\\nThe three most signiﬁcant observations made in the present\\nstudy were as follows: ﬁrst, the roots accumulated high Na\\n+con-\\ncentrations (means across salinity levels and time periods) in thepresent study (0.40 mmol g\\n−1dry weight), which is approximately\\nat par with the Na+accumulated in the main stem (0.39 mmol g−1\\ndry weight). It is in marked contrast to our previous results,\\nwhere main stems accumulated 24% higher Na+concentrations\\nthan roots on a mean basis ( Sharma et al., 2011 ). In the present\\nstudy of short-term salinity stress applied during late ﬂoweringand post-ﬂowering growth stages, the drought-sensitive parent H77/833-2 accumulated 9% higher Na\\n+concentration in its roots\\nthan the drought-tolerant parent PRLT 2/89-33, whereas in theprevious study involving long-term salinity application through-out the plant growth cycle, this trend was exactly reversed. Thesedifferences in the present and previous results suggest differentmechanisms involved in counteracting salinity stress applied atdifferent growth stages. The reduced transpiration rates reportedin drought-tolerant parent and the two QTL-NILs, as a result ofconstitutively enhanced foliar ABA levels ( Kholová et al., 2010a,b ),\\ncould explain the differences observed in both the short-term andlong-term salinity stress treatments.\\nThe second noteworthy observation made was that Na\\n+con-\\ncentration in roots of H 77/833-2 reached its maximum at ECiw15 dS m\\n−1within 24 h after salinity imposition. However, root Na+\\ncontinued to increase with time in PRLT 2/89-33 and QTL-NILs\\n(ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01004) from 24 to 120 h and reached atits maximum at 120 h stage ( Fig. 1 B). Conclusively, though both\\nparents accumulated similar levels of Na\\n+in their roots after 120 h\\nat ECiw 15 dS m−1, higher rate of Na+accumulation in roots of H\\n77/833-2 results in greater negative impact on its growth and pro-ductivity compared to PRLT 2/89-33 and two QTL-NILs. Further,after 120 h at ECiw 15 dS m\\n−1, the Na/K ratio was 8.5 times that\\nof the initial value in roots of H 77/833-2 while similar increasein PRLT 2/89-33 and two QTL-NILs was 6.5 and 7 times, respec-tively. Such clear differences in the roots of parental genotypeswere not observed previously ( Sharma et al., 2011 ), mainly because\\nthe root growth occurred under normal conditions until 45 DAS inthe present study, providing a higher root capacity to accumulatethese toxic ions.\\nDifferential accumulation of Na\\n+was clearly evident in the\\nmain stem and individual leaves of the two parental genotypesas well the QTL NILs. Na\\n+accumulation was 6 times higher in\\nthe main stem of H 77/833-2 120 h after imposition of the ECiw15 dS m\\n−1salinity stress, whereas it increased by 3.5 times in PRLTP.C.

Similar increases in the two QTL-NILs were 3.5- and 4.5-\\nfold respectively. These observations could be a simple function ofthe drought-tolerant parent and those of the QTL-NILs having lowertranspiration rates than the drought-sensitive parent [as reportedbyKholová et al. (2010a,b) , but not measured in the present study],\\nand so drawing in less salt while taking up soil water to supporttranspiration.\\nComparison of Na\\n+concentrations amongst different leaves on\\nmain stems revealed differential distribution of ions between oldand young leaves. The oldest leaf (leaf position 1) of PRLT 2/89-33 (Fig. 2 B) started to show increased Na\\n+concentration at ECiw\\n10 dS m−1and stored Na+at twice the concentration as found in\\nthe oldest leaves of H 77/833-2 48 h after imposition of salinitystress ( Fig. 2 A). When compared with the drought-sensitive par-\\nent at 120 h, Na\\n+concentration in the lowermost leaf (leaf position\\n1) in the drought-tolerant parent and the two QTL-NILs was two-fold greater. Most signiﬁcantly, comparison of older and youngerleaves in the genotypes at ECiw 15 dS m\\n−1revealed that the low-\\nermost three leaves (leaf positions 1, 2, 3) on the main stem ofthe drought-tolerant parent and the two QTL-NILs showed signiﬁ-cantly higher Na\\n+concentrations than the uppermost ﬁve younger\\nleaves (leaf positions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) on the same main stems 120 hafter salinity stress imposition. These results indicated that Na\\n+\\nions were not uniformly distributed in the leaves of the drought-tolerant parent and drought-tolerant QTL-NILs; but accumulatedpreferentially in the older leaves, whereas the drought-sensitiveparent showed signiﬁcantly higher Na\\n+concentration in all main\\nstem leaves irrespective of their age ( Fig. 2 ).\\nWe observed therefore that with the increase in imposed salin-\\nity level from ECiw 10 to 15 dS m−1, the drought-tolerant parent\\nshowed consistency in its control of the distribution of Na+amongst\\nits older and younger leaves, with successively younger leaves tak-ing the least share of the salt stress. However, similar consistencywas not shown by drought-sensitive parent. Storing Na\\n+preferen-\\ntially in older leaves and limiting transmission of salt into youngerleaves in drought-tolerant parent and the two QTL-NILs served asa protective mechanism. Controlled uptake and better compart-mentalization of Na\\n+besides the ability to maintain low Na+/K+\\nhave been described as important mechanisms of salt tolerancein plants ( Munns and Tester, 2008; deVos et al., 2013 ). Similar\\ndifferential distribution of Na\\n+ions between old (expanded) and\\nyoung (expanding) leaves of plants grown under high-salinity con-ditions has been reported in other salt-tolerant crops ( Greenway\\net al., 1965, 1966; Yeo and Flowers, 1986; Soliman and Dos, 1992;Nakamura et al., 1996; Ramanjulu and Sudhakar, 2001; Kumar et al.,\\n2003 ).\\nVarious studies have reported varietal differences with respect\\nto the decline in leaf chlorophyll concentration under increasingsalinity stress as well as under increased leaf Na\\n+concentration\\n(Yeo and Flowers, 1983; Lutts et al., 1996; Netondo et al., 2004 ). The\\npresent results showed higher leaf chlorophyll concentration in thedrought-sensitive parent H 77/833-2 than in the drought-tolerantparent PRLT 2/89-33 and two QTL-NILs at the start of salinity stressimposition (0 h). However, H 77/833-2 showed greater reduction inleaf chlorophyll concentration than PRLT 2/89-33 under short-term(present experiment) as well as under long-term salt stress ( Sharma\\net al., 2011 ). The stability of leaf chlorophyll, being membrane-\\nbound, is dependent upon membrane stability, which under salineconditions is seldom maintained. It was shown in rice that cellultrastructure differs in its stability under varying leaf Na\\n+concen-\\ntration, causing higher loss of chlorophyll in salt-sensitive varieties(Yeo and Flowers, 1986 ). There were also large varietal differences\\nin the average tissue Na\\n+concentration associated with 50% leaf\\nchlorophyll loss; higher leaf Na+is required to bring about a 50%\\nloss of chlorophyll in salt-tolerant varieties than in salt-sensitiverice varieties ( Flowers et al., 1985; Yeo and Flowers, 1986; Lutts\\net al., 1996 ). Under short term salinity stress in pearl millet, higher\\nleaf Na\\n+was required to cause 50% loss in chlorophyll in drought-\\ntolerant parent than drought-sensitive parent, at 24 and 48 h aftersalinity imposition, whereas, the tissue tolerance values of the twoQTL-NILs did not fall in between the values of the two parents.However, the tissue tolerance values computed from long term saltstress in pearl millet showed 50% loss of chlorophyll at leaf Na\\n+of\\n0.12 mmol g−1fresh weight in H 77/833-2, and 0.16 mmol in PRLT\\n2/89-33 and the two QTL NILs. The short-term salinity stress did notshow such trends in tissue tolerance mainly because the stress wasimposed at a later growth stage (45 DAS) when the leaves were fullyexpanded. Chlorophyll concentration, however, is not necessarilyan exhaustive index of tissue tolerance. Indeed, Yeo et al. (1985)\\ndemonstrated that in rice genotypes, photosynthesis was reducedby half at a leaf Na\\n+concentration that did not reduce chlorophyll\\nlevels.\\nMany investigators have demonstrated the osmo-protective\\nrole of proline at the whole-plant level and in cell cultures ( Kishore\\net al., 1995; Misra and Gupta, 2005; Szabados and Savouré, 2010 ).\\nIncreased proline content in transgenic plants is associated withenhanced tolerance to various abiotic stresses ( Kishore et al., 1995;\\nKasukawe et al., 2004 ). In the presence of low water potentials56 P.C. Sharma et al. / Environmental and Experimental Botany 102 (2014) 48–57\\nunder salinity stress, the accumulation of compatible osmolytes\\ninvolved in osmoregulation allows additional water to be taken upfrom the environment, thus buffering the immediate effect of watershortage within the plant. In the present study, at ECiw 15 dS m\\n−1,\\nthe proline concentration had increased by 52% after 120 h of salin-ity stress in H 77/833-2, whereas the comparable increase was 87%in PRLT 2/89-33 ( Fig. 5 ). The two QTL-NILs showed the pattern\\nsimilar to the drought-tolerant parent.\\nThe parallel increase in proline concentration with decreased\\nNa\\n+concentration in younger leaves of PRLT 2/89-33 and the two\\nQTL NILs suggests that this differential distribution of salt and pro-line together between young and old leaves ( i.e., an increase in\\nthe level of salt in old leaves, and an accumulation of proline inyoung leaves) is allowing the younger leaves to support sufﬁcientmetabolic and physiological activity through osmotic adjustmentfor survival under high-salinity conditions. Leaf proline concen-tration also increased under increasing long-term root zone saltstress. However, the behaviour of the genotypes with this DT QTLallele in terms of proline accumulation was exactly opposite underlong-term and short-term salt stress. Though the drought-sensitiveparent showed higher proline concentrations than the drought-tolerant parent under long-term salt stress, the sensitive parentrequired higher leaf Na\\n+than the tolerant parent to produce the\\nsame level of proline, as shown in Fig. 4 B. For example, the sen-\\nsitive parent required 0.053 mmol Na+g−1leaf fresh weight to\\nproduce 1.00 mg proline, g−1leaf fresh weight, whereas the simi-\\nlar level of proline was produced by 0.033 mmol Na+g−1leaf fresh\\nweight in the tolerant parent. The results are in accordance withthe studies where free proline increased appreciably in salt toler-ant plants ( Kumar et al., 2003; Demiral and Türkan, 2005; Misra\\nand Gupta, 2005; Koca et al., 2007; Veeranagamallaiah et al., 2007 )\\nand also where salt-sensitive cultivars accumulated signiﬁcantlyhigher levels of proline compared to tolerant ones ( Lutts et al., 1999;\\ndeLacerda et al., 2003; Vaidyanathan et al., 2003 ) as the proline con-\\ncentration differences between tolerant and sensitive genotypesdepends up on the timing of onset, severity, and duration of theimposed stress.\\n5. Conclusions\\nIn total, our results suggest that the hybrid of drought-tolerant\\nparent PRLT 2/89-33 performed better under post-ﬂowering salin-ity stress by differentially regulating Na\\n+accumulation in roots,\\nbetter compartmentalization of accumulated Na+in the main stem,\\nlimiting translocation of Na+from older leaves to metabolically\\nactive younger leaves, and restriction of Na+inﬂux and its effective\\nefﬂux in leaves through osmotic adjustment facilitated by adjustedaccumulation of proline. These ﬁndings are compatible with theearlier observation that the LG 2 drought tolerance QTL allele of thisparent is associated with constitutively elevated leaf ABA levels andreduced leaf transpirations rates.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe work reported in this study was conducted under “Col-\\nlaborative Project with Scientists & Technologists of Indian OriginAbroad” (CP-STIO) award to P.C.S. and R.S.Y. by the Departmentof Science and Technology (DST), Government of India.

Although temperature increases in the tropics are predicted to\\nbe smaller than in other regions (e.g. boreal zone, Collins et al., 2013),\\ntropical forests experience much lower diurnal and seasonal variationin temperature than temperate or boreal forests, and over geological\\ntime have experienced a relatively stable climate, potentially reducing\\nthe acclimation potential of tropical tree species (Janzen, 1967;\\nDusenge and Way, 2017).

Evidence of acclimation of gsto higher\\ntemperatures in trees over the long-term is varied, however some spe-\\ncies show declines (Way et al., 2015). The instantaneous response of gs\\nto increased CO 2is to decrease, which reduces water loss while main-\\ntaining a high internal leaf CO 2concentration (c i) (Gaastra, 1959). Si-\\nmilarly,underlong-termCO 2enrichment, gsreduces.Suchdeclinesin gs\\nmay increase leaf temperature (T L) through reduced evaporative\\ncooling (underincreasedairtemperatures,reducedevaporative coolingwould also depend on the extent of increased D,Oren et al., 1999).\\nHigher T\\nLcould push leaves beyond their photosynthetic temperature\\noptima (T opt) (Doughty and Goulden, 2008; Slot and Winter, 2017c),\\nand potentially above their physiological temperature tolerances(O’Sullivan et al., 2017) causing permanent leaf damage under extreme\\nheat conditions (Warren et al., 2011). While the response of g\\nsto\\ncombined elevated CO 2(eC) and temperature (eT) has rarely been\\ntested (Way et al., 2015; Becklin et al., 2017), experiments on eu-\\ncalyptus (Ghannoum et al., 2010), douglas-fir (Lewis et al., 2002) andloblolly pine (Wertin et al., 2010) showed little interactive effect; if the\\ntwo do interact and lead to even greater decreases in g\\ns, this would\\nincrease TLfurther.\\nLong-term increasing air temperatures and CO 2concentrations are\\nalsopredictedtoinducechangesinnet photosynthesis,bothdirectlybyimpacting biochemical processes and indirectly through changes in g\\ns.\\nIncreases in TLeither directly from increased air temperatures or in-\\ndirectlyfromalong-termreductionin gscouldshifttheleafbeyond Topt,\\nleading to reductions in photosynthesis. Some experimental studieshave shown partial photosynthetic acclimation to increasing tempera-\\ntures through increases in T\\nopt(Yamori et al., 2014; Slot and Winter,\\n2017b), which could occur due to alterations in membrane fluidity,expression of heat shock proteins, and production of greater quantities\\nof Rubisco activase or a heat-stable Rubisco activase (Yamori et al.,\\n2014).

Photosynthetic capacities are also influenced by\\ngrowth CO 2concentrations. Under high CO 2, Rubisco concentrations\\ntypically reduce and hence Vcmaxdeclines (Way et al., 2015).

A. glandulosa is a pioneer species often found, but not\\nrestricted to, riverine environments (Pascotto, 2006), distributed in the\\nAtlantic forest, western Amazon/Andes and central America (GBIF\\nSecretariat, 2017), with over 100,000,000 individual trees estimated to\\noccur in the Amazon (ter Steege et al., 2013).

Methods\\n2.1. Experimental setup\\nThe study was carried out at the University of São Paulo from\\nFebruary to March 2017 (23.56°S, 46.73°W, elevation 760m).\\nAlchornea glandulosa seedlings were sourced from a local plant nursery\\nwhere they were germinated in shade houses before growing for 12months outside.\\nTheseedlings weremoved to the glasshousein September 2016 and\\ninNovembertransferredintocontainers(4l PVCpotswithoneplantper\\nplot). Hoagland fertilizer solution was added every 2 weeks. The ex-periment was conducted using four polycarbonate open top chambers\\n(OTCs) with modifications (Aidar et al., 2002) located within the glass\\nhouse. The four treatments were: i) control (aTaC), ii) elevated CO\\n2\\n(ambient temperature, 800ppm CO 2, aTeC), iii) elevated temperature\\n(temperature 1.5°C above ambient, ambient CO 2, eTaC), and iv) ele-\\nvated CO 2and elevated temperature (temperature 1.5°C above am-\\nbient, 800ppm CO 2,eTeC). Each chamber had an air inlet at the base\\nwith a fan, and a spiral heater and/or CO 2gas inlet was present de-\\npending onthetreatment(FigureS1). Temperaturewithin thechamberwas thermostatically controlled using RICS software (Remote In-\\ntegratedControlSystem)withtheheaterswitchedonorofftomaintain\\na higher temperature than the unheated chambers. No attempt was\\nmade to control for differences in Ddue to temperature treatments as\\nincreases in temperature would be associated with increases in Dunder\\nfuture conditions assuming no change in relative humidity. CO\\n2was\\npassivelyaddedtotheeCtreatmentsthroughtheuseofpressurizedCO 2\\ncylinders. The CO 2concentrations of the eC chambers was monitored\\ndaily and the flow into the chambers altered at a valve if the con-\\ncentration decreased. Further details of the experimental design can be\\nfound in Aidar et al., 2002 andde Souza et al. (2008). Ten seedlings\\nwere placed into each chamber on 1 February 2017 and allowed to\\nacclimateforonemonthbeforemeasurementsbegan.Verticalheightof\\neach seedling was recorded prior to placement in the OTCs, and pla-\\ncementofseedlingsintoOTCswasstratifiedtoensureanevenspreadof\\nvertical heights.\\n2.2. Microclimate measurements\\nWithin each OTC air temperature (T A), relative humidity (h) and\\nCO2concentration were measured at 5min intervals (Testo 535, Testo\\nInc., Flanders, NJ, USA). An additional TAsensor (107 thermistor,\\nCampbell Scientific) recorded air temperature every 10s inside each\\nchamber.\\n2.3. Physiological measurements\\n2.3.1.

Environmental and Experimental Botany 158 (2019) 28–39\\n29to movement of the seedling into the OTCs. Prior to selection, we\\nverified that the leaves were photosynthetically active. A two-junction\\nthermocouple (copper-constantan, type T) that measured leaf-to-air\\ntemperature difference (ΔT L) was attached to the abaxial surface of\\neach sample leaf using a piece of breathable tape (Transpore, 3M, St.Paul MN) following the protocol of Fauset et al. (2018). One thermo-\\ncouple was used per leaf. Absolute leaf temperatures (T\\nL) were calcu-\\nlated from ΔTLandTAin each chamber measured by the thermistors. A\\nphotosynthetically active radiation (PAR) sensor built to the specifica-tion ofFielder and Comeau (2000) was positioned adjacent to each\\nsample leaf at the same angle and orientation.

Photosynthetic measurements\\nThe temperature response of photosynthesis was measured using a\\nLI-COR 6400XT portable photosynthesis measurement system (LI-COR,\\nNebraska). Data were collected from 10 to 18 March 2018. Light re-\\nsponse curves on 3 leaves showed saturating photosynthesis at\\n800μmolm\\n−2s-1PAR (Figure S2), hence all measurements were taken\\nat 800μmolm−2s-1PAR using the standard red-blue LED light source.\\nNote that the glasshouse roof was made of a diffusing plastic which\\nreduced the incoming PAR by c. 60% compared with the outside, and\\nleaf level PAR reached c. 800μmolm−2s-1, varying with leaf angleand\\norientation. Three seedlings from each OTC were selected for photo-synthesis measurements and the leaf measurements were performed on\\nthe same leaf as leaf temperature monitoring. Two sets of measure-\\nments were made, net photosynthesis-temperature curves (A-T\\nLcurves\\nwhere net photosynthesis at saturating light intensity is measured atdifferent temperatures), and A-c\\nicurves (where net photosynthesis at\\nsaturating light intensity is measured at different CO 2concentrations)\\nat three different temperatures. A-Tcurves were run with the CO 2\\nconcentration of the relevant OTC (either 400 of 800ppm CO 2) and\\nassimilation was measured at leaf chamber temperatures of 20, 25, 27,\\n29, 31, 33, 35 and 40°C, with 5 measurements recorded at each tem-\\nperature after the photosynthetic rate and gshad stabilized.\\nMeasurements at 20, 30 and 35°C were supplemented using the re-levant measurements from the A-c\\nicurves. A-cicurves used the fol-\\nlowing sequence of CO 2concentrations (ppm); 400, 200, 100, 50, 400,\\n600, 800, 1200, 1500, 2000. A-cicurves were performed at three\\ntemperatures, 20, 30, and 35°C, and each curve was performed twicefor each leaf on either side of the midrib. For all measurements, hwas\\nmaintainedascloseaspossibleto50%usingacombinationofdesiccantand adjusting the air flow rate; it was difficult to maintain this hat leaf\\ntemperatures above 37°C (on average 46%, minimum values were40%). The temperature of the chamber was mostly controlled using theinbuilt temperature control system. In addition, for most of the mea-\\nsurements the sensor head was placed inside a specially designed\\ntemperature control chamber to enable better control of the chamber\\ntemperature (Yepes Mayorga, 2010). The temperature control box was\\nswitched off during measurements but was used to aid the change of\\nchamber temperature between measurements. Measurements weremade at an atmospheric pressure in the greenhouse of 92.6kPa.\\n2.3.4.

Microclimate over the study period\\nThe experimental period coincided with an anomalously hot\\nsummerinSãoPaulocityincludinga4dayheatwave(Fig.1).Usingthe\\ndefinition of a heatwave from Russo et al. (2015) as ≥3 consecutive\\ndays where the maximum temperature exceeds the 90th percentile of\\nmaximum temperatures from a monthly window for the period\\n1981–2010, and climate data for the Mirante de Santana weather sta-\\ntion (INMET), a four day heatwave period occurred (maximum tem-\\nperatures above 32.3°C) in mid-February (Fig. 1, Figure S5). The\\nheatwave occurred during the acclimation period but before the in-\\nitiation of data collection. During this time the maximum daily air\\ntemperatures within the OTCs exceeded 45°C (Fig. 1).\\nMean daily temperatures within the OTCs over the acclimation andmeasurement periods were significantly different between chambers(F=5.4,P= 0.001,ANOVA, Fig.2a).Temperaturesweresignificantly\\nlower in the aTeC treatment (28.8 ± 2.3°C mean ± SD) than theeTeC treatment (30.4 ± 2.3°C), however the difference between aTaC\\n(29.0 ± 2.2°C)andeTaC(30.3 ± 2.4°C)wasmarginallyinsignificant\\n(P= 0.07, Tukey post-hoc test, Fig. 1a).

The micro-climate conditions under which no significant differences were found\\nwere both in the high PAR category where there were much fewer data\\npoints, and the pattern in the data was similar to other microclimates.\\nThe extent of the difference in ΔT\\nLbetween aTaC and aTeC increased\\nunder increasing air temperature and increasing PAR, with a difference\\nof 2.8°C under high PAR and high air temperature.

We mea-\\nsured the physiological responses on leaves formed before initiation of\\nthe experiment, which had been exposed to the treatments for c. 5\\nweeks. As stomatal properties (e.g. density) often differ on leaves\\nformed in high CO 2environments (Saxe et al., 1998), there could po-\\ntentially be greater changes than we observed, had new leaves formed.Whilst this is quite possible, the long-term response of g\\nsto CO2is ty-\\npically similar to the short term response (Way et al., 2015), and hencewhile the mechanism of reduced g\\nsmay be different in short and long-\\nterm studies, the gsmay be similar. However, a caveat to our results is\\nthat to truly observe the acclimation of leaves to the treatments, longeracclimation periods and production of new leaves is necessary.\\nThe observed responses of g\\nsto elevated temperature varyconsiderably in the few studies available (Way et al., 2015). Here wefind strong reductions in g\\nsin the temperature treatments with a 49.6%\\n(95% CI 42.2–56.5 %) reduction under the eTaC treatment and 53.0%(95% CI 52.9–58.3 %) reduction in the combined eTeC treatment, al-\\nthough we did not find any significant difference between treatments\\nfor the g\\n1parameter value. This may be because the Medlyn et al.\\n(2011)model incorporates the ambient CO 2concentration, and if the\\nshort-termandlongterm gsresponsetoCO 2isthesametherewouldnot\\nbe a difference. The declines in gsare not driven purely by higher DLin\\nthe eT chambers as there are significant differences even when DLis\\ncontrolled for (Table 1, Fig. 4) or when gsis analysed within a narrow\\nDLrange (data not shown). This shows acclimation of gsdue to higher\\nair temperature and/or DL(both quantities strongly co-varied) which\\nwill reduce water loss from the plants. There were no significant dif-ferences in g\\nsbetween the eTaC and eTeC treatments, hence the re-\\nsponse to the temperature treatment (with significant differences) was\\nFig.6.Diurnal cycles of leaf-to-air temperature difference (a,b), leaf temperature (c,d), PAR (e,f), D(g,h), for chambers with ambient air temperature (a,c,e,g) and\\nelevated temperatures (b,d,f,h).

An experimental study of gas exchange of Solanum lycopersicum\\n(cherry tomato) measured during and following a +14°C heatwave\\nshowed reduced gsduring the heatwave, which remained low when\\nmeasured 5 days after the heatwave (Duan et al., 2016). Similarly,Duarte et al. (2016) found reduced g\\nsofPseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas\\nfir) during +12°C heatwaves which remained when measured one\\nmonth later. This is somewhat in contrast with recent research sug-\\ngesting stomata remain open under very high air temperatures for in-\\ncreased evaporative cooling (Slot et al., 2016; Slot and Winter, 2017b;\\nUrban et al., 2017; Drake et al., 2018). Responses are likely to be\\nspecies specific,with anexampleofalatesuccessionalspeciesreducing\\ngsunderheatwaveconditionswhileapioneerspeciesshowedincreased\\ngs(Vargas and Cordero, 2013). However these studies are assessing the\\ninstantaneous response of gsto short-term warming rather than the\\nlong-termresponse.Afieldstudyreportingtheimpactoffourmonthsofexperimentally elevated temperature on g\\nsof existing leaves showed a\\nc. 25% reduction with 2°C temperature increase averaged across sixtropical species (Doughty, 2011), lower than we observed.

Other studies with a\\ncongeneric species show that gsofA. triplinervia is more weakly linked\\ntoDLthan other measured species (García-Núñez et al., 1995; Fauset\\net al., 2018). A weaker relationship between gsandDLis expected for\\nlow wood density pioneer species compared to species with higherwood density (Lin et al., 2015). In addition, as the species is commonly\\nfound in riparian areas (and therefore with access to a good water\\nsupply), its lack of stomatal control is not surprising. Our results show\\nthat despite a weak instantaneous response of g\\nsto microclimate, A.\\nglandulosa still showed acclimation and reduction in gsin response to\\nlong-term microclimate change. Hence, the short-term response of gs\\ndoes not provide information on the long-term response.\\n4.2. CO 2impacts on leaf temperature\\nThe lower gsas a result of elevated CO 2caused increases in leaf\\ntemperatures (Fig. 5). The differences in ΔTLincreased with increasing\\nPAR at the leaf surface, and to a lesser extent with increasing air tem-\\nperatureand D.Thisshowsthatthedifferencesinleaftemperaturesdue\\nto CO2-altered gsare more apparent under high thermal stress condi-\\ntions (high PAR and high air temperature), and therefore that this im-\\npact is likely to be stronger under heat waves, which are expected to\\nincrease in frequency during the 21st century (Coumou and Robinson,\\n2013).Whenathighairtemperatures,differencesin ΔTLduetoreduced\\ngscould have significant consequences, as seen in observations of pre-\\nmature leaf senescence during a heatwave in a temperate FACE ex-\\nperiment (Warren et al., 2011). While the average differences in ΔTL\\nbetween aTaC and aTeC reached 2.8°C under high light and air tem-\\nperature, the light conditions were limited by the greenhouse en-\\nvironment which reached only 1000μmolm−2s-1.

It is worth noting that such high leaf temperatures are\\noften considered to be detrimental to photosynthetic functions (e.g.\\nRubisco activase activity is strongly temperature sensitive with inhibi-\\ntion found above 35°C [Crafts-Brandner and Salvucci, 2000]). More-\\nover, photosystem II (PSII) activity declines rapidly above temperature\\nthresholdsof41.5–50.8°C(O’Sullivanetal.,2017).However,plantsare\\nwell adapted to their environment, with temperature thresholds of PSII\\nincreasing from arctic to tropical habitats (O’Sullivan et al., 2017), and\\neven increasing thermal tolerance of PSII over very short timescales\\n(days) in response to high temperatures (Drake et al., 2018). Slot et al.\\n(2017c)foundthat ToptmeasuredinthefieldinPanamawasaroundthe\\nmean maximum daily temperature (30–32°C) for all 42 species mea-\\nsured, and that, for a smaller sample of four species, it was gsrather\\nthan Rubisco activase, Jmax,Vcmaxor light respiration that limited the\\nphotosynthetic rates at high temperatures (Slot and Winter, 2017a). In\\nanother study, Toptwas higher than daily maximum air temperature in\\nmoist and wet tropical forest sites in Puerto Rico (Mau et al., 2018). Inthe case of the A. glandulosa seedlings measured here, the mean max-\\nimum daily temperature over the acclimation and measurement periodwas 40–42°C (varying by treatment, Fig. 1), matching the minimum\\npotential T\\noptof 40°C, and showing tolerance to the high temperatures\\nto which they were exposed. Measurement under higher temperatures\\nwould be necessary to find the Toptfor these plants. Over the measured\\ntemperaturerange, gs,VcmaxandJmaxdidnotdecline.Yet,itshouldalso\\nbenotedthattheratesof A,VcmaxandJmaxwerefairlylow(c.3,40and\\n35μmolm−2s-1respectively, at the highest values and under ambient\\nCO2).Forexample,thesearelowerthan Aof12–16μmolm−2s-1across\\n42Panamanianspecies(SlotandWinter,2017c)and5–12μmolm−2s-1\\nfor four species in Puerto Rico (Mau et al., 2018), and Vcmaxof\\n70–300μmolm−2s-1andJmaxof 80–220μmolm−2s-1across four Pa-\\nnamanian species (Slot and Winter, 2017a), all at their optimum tem-\\nperatures. The measured rates are also lower than plants in other high\\ntemperature environments e.g. five desert species with Aranging\\n19–35μmolm−2s-1(Mooneyetal.,1981),and Mediterraneancorkoak\\nwithVcmaxandJmaxboth over 150μmolm−2s-1(Ghouil et al., 2003).\\nThus, high temperature tolerance of photosynthetic machinery in A.\\nglandulosa may come at a cost of lower photosynthetic rates. An alter-\\nnative explanation for the low photosynthetic rates is the low lightconditions within the greenhouse, with maximum leaf surface PAR of\\n800–1000μmolm\\n−2s-1.Inthefield,maximumPARislikelytobemuch\\nhigher (>2000μmolm−2s-1), and leaves may achieve higher photo-\\nsynthetic rates. The low light conditions in the greenhouse also have\\nimplications for the high temperature tolerance observed. Because at\\nhigh temperatures photosynthetic biochemistry is under greater stress,\\nthere is a greater need for photoprotection from high incoming radia-\\ntion. Perhaps under the higher light conditions found in the field, very\\nhigh temperature tolerance of photosynthesis may be more difficult to\\nachieve. Field studies under high temperature conditions are needed to\\nestablish whether the high tolerance we find here also occurs under\\nnatural conditions.\\nAs forgs, the impacts of increased CO 2followed expectations fromprevious studies with increased net photosynthesis when measured at\\ngrowth CO 2, a steeper slope of Ain response to temperature, and\\ndownregulation of photosynthetic capacity (Fig. 8,9). The steeper slopeis duetothereduction inoxygenationofRubiscodueto higher c\\niunder\\nelevated CO 2, which otherwise increases with temperature due to the\\nreduced affinity of Rubisco for CO 2with higher temperature (Long,\\n1991). The effect of the downregulation can be seen when the tem-perature response of Ais plotted with added points taken from the A-c\\ni\\ncurves at 400 and 800ppm CO 2for the elevated and ambient CO 2\\ntreatments respectively, showing that without the downregulation of\\nphotosynthetic capacity Awould have been higher in the elevated CO 2\\ntreatment (Figure S9).\\n4.4.

Introduction\\nIn their natural ecosystem plants are usually under stress due to\\ndifferent biotic (pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses) and\\nabiotic factors (environmental: drought, salt, flood, heat, cold, and\\nmetals) that can affect normal growth, development, and yield, con-\\nsequently affecting global food security. Understanding how plants\\nsense and respond to stress signals is a key research question askedin\\nthe backdropofclimate changeandfoodsecurity.In response to stress, plants undergo changes in gene regulation,\\nmetabolism, and physiology. Plants typically respond to abiotic stressby producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Jaspers and Kangasjärvi,\\n2010); however, ROS are potentially toxic, being either harmful or\\nbeneficial to plant cells depending on the concentration (Miller et al.,\\n2010).

NO also has a role in re-\\nspiratory function, namely electron transport pathways in mitochon-\\ndria, where it modulates ROS thereby activating defense mechanisms\\nthroughenhancedantioxidantproductioninplantsexposedtovarious\\nabioticstresses(Zottinietal.,2002).Additionally,exogenoussupplyof\\nNO leads to activation of antioxidant enzymes, especially superoxide\\ndismutase,and restrictssuperoxide anionand lipidO\\n2and organicra-\\ndicals (R) (Shi et al., 2007). However, NO was also shown to be anendogenous modulator of several plant hormones, in addition to in-\\nhibiting the induced programmed cell death and aiding in stomatal\\nfunction in several plant species such as Arabidopsis, wheat, and pea\\n(Bright et al., 2006; Leshem and Haramaty, 1996; Mata, 2001). NOprovokes a wide range of physiological responses in plants, including\\ngermination, development, flowering, senescence, and abiotic stress.\\nMoreover, NO possesses several additional properties favorable to ac-\\ntivity as a signaling messenger during unfavorable or multiple stress\\nconditions such as the presence of free radical, small size redox mole-\\ncules,neutral,andeasilydiffusiblethroughacellmembrane,allthese\\nmake it a very significant agent to act as a dynamic molecule\\n(Domingosetal.,2015).NOisknowntointeractdirectlyorindirectly\\nwith a wide range of targets, leading to altered gene expression and\\nprotein function and thereby affecting the phenotypic response. NO-\\nmediated stress responses and the underlying mechanisms have beenextensively studied by several scientists (Spoel and Loake, 2011; Yuet al., 2012), though with variable results due to the use of different\\napproaches (Ahmad et al., 2016; Begara-Morales et al., 2014; Manaietal.,2014).VariationsinendogenousNOlevelsandorexogenousNO\\napplication has shown to regulate abiotic stress resistance suggesting\\nthatthisapproachmaycontributeinenhancingcropproductionunder\\nstress conditions (Ahmad et al., 2018; Farooq et al., 2009; Siddiqui\\net al., 2011). However, a greater understanding is needed of the mo-\\nlecular mechanisms through which NO directly or indirectly mitigates\\nthe adverse effects of abiotic stress. In this article, we review and dis-\\ncuss the role of NO with regard to exogenous application and en-\\ndogenous synthesis in increasing plant stress tolerance related specifi-\\ncallytodrought,salt,andheavymetalstress.Inaddition,weassessNO-\\nmediatedpost-translationalmodificationsinplants.\\n1.1. Source and synthesis of NO in plants\\nInplants,NOisknownasamultifunctionalbioactivemoleculeand\\nplays an important role as a regulator of plant physiology, disease re-\\nsistance, and stress tolerance (Wang et al., 2010a). Endogenous NO\\nsynthesiscanoccurinstressedorgansorcellsandNOdiffusesintra-as\\nwell as intercellularly (Fröhlich and Durner, 2011). In plants, NO\\nsynthesis was first reported decades ago in legumes, i.e., soybean, bysynthetic inhibitor herbicides as well as under dark anaerobic condi-\\ntions (Klepper, 1991, 1979; Nishimura, 1986). Although, several stu-\\ndiesreportedNOsynthesisinplants,theexactenzymaticsourceofNO\\nis yet to be fully elucidated. Rather, the scientific community now\\nagrees on several oxidative and reductive routes discovered for NO\\nsynthesis in plants. Determining the exact mechanism of NO synthesis\\nFig.1.SchematicdiagramshowingthemajorsourcesofNOandthedifferentmechanismsinvolvedinNOsynthesis.(1)Plasmamembrane:NOsynthesisoccursvia\\nnitratereductase(NR)-basednitrateornitritesubstrate(PM-NR/NiNOR)reductiontoNOthroughreductionpathways,andacidicpHconvertsNO−\\n2toNOandO 2.\\n(2) Chloroplast: NO synthesis occurs both by reduction and oxidation reactions; NR-based reduction produces NO, NOSLE activity (Nitric oxide synthase-like\\nenzyme)-basedNOsynthesisoccursusingL-arginineasasubstrateinthepresenceofNADPH.However,thepathwaysarenotknowninplants.(3)Mitochondria:\\nreduction and oxidation reactions produce NO via complexes I to IV, using NR-based nitrite as a substrate (Mit-NiOR) and in an NADPH-dependent process, L-\\narginineisconvertedtoL-citrullinethroughNOSLEactivitytoproduceNO.(4)Peroxisomes:reductionofNO 2ˉbyXORinanNADPH-dependentreaction,oxidation\\nof L-arg/ctir through NOSLE activity in an NADPH-dependent reaction using Ca2+/Calmodulin as substrates.

(6) Cytoplasm: NO synthesis occurs by both reduction and oxidation\\nreactions; NO−3 is reduced to NO−\\n2in an NADPH-dependent manner, polyamine and hydroxylamine are also oxidized to produce NO but the exact molecular\\nmechanismsareunknown.NOmayalsobeproducedbyanunknownsourcefromGSHtoNOtoGSNOviaaglutathione-basedpathway(modifiedfrom Sahayand\\nGupta,2017).R.B.S. Nabi, et al. Environmental and Experimental Botany 161 (2019) 120–133\\n121andhowitisregulatedinplantsiscomplicatedbytheexistenceofsuch\\nseveral possible mechanisms of NO synthesis. Some studies have in-\\ndicated that NO synthesis may occur in response to biotic as well as\\nabioticstresscausedbysalinity,drought,cold,andheavymetal(Gould\\netal.,2003;Sunetal.,2012;Tanetal.,2012).Ontheotherhand,NO\\nsynthesis in animalshas been well documented.NOis bio-synthesized\\nthroughtheactivityoftheenzymeNOsynthase(NOS),threeisoforms\\nofwhichhavebeenidentifiedinanimals:endothelial(eNOS),neuronal\\n(nNOS), and inducible (iNOS) (Alderton et al., 2001). Of these, the\\nearlier two forms eNOS and nNOS are constitutively expressed to\\nmaintain a certain basal level of NO in animal cells. Whereas, iNOS is\\ninduced under different stressed conditions to enhance NO biosynth-\\nesis. However, NO synthesis in plants appears to be a more complex\\nprocessandtodate,noenzymewithsimilaractivityhasbeenidentified\\nin plants. Furthermore, approximately eight major oxidative and re-\\nductivepathwayshavebeenidentifiedinplantsthatarethoughttobe\\ninvolved in NO biosynthesis (Crawford and Guo, 2005). Oxidative\\npathways include oxidation of (1) L-arginine by NOS-like enzyme, (2)\\npolyamines, and (3) hydroxylamine, whereas reductive pathways in-\\nclude nitrite reduction of: (4) nitrate reductase (NR), (5) plasma\\nmembrane-bound nitrite: NO reductase, (6) xanthine oxidoreductase\\n(XOR), (7) cytochrome-c oxidase and/or reductase, and (8) non-enzy-\\nmaticreductionofnitriteunderacidicconditions(nitriteisprotonated\\nto form nitrous acid (HNO 2) in a freely reversible reaction that is oc-\\ncurred at low pH). The source of origin and various NO-related me-chanisms have been well explained [reviewed by (Gupta et al., 2011;\\nKhan, 2013; Procházková et al., 2014)]. An overview of the potential\\nsources of plant NO production in the chloroplast, peroxisome, mi-\\ntochondria, cytoplasm, plasma membrane, apoplast, and unknown is\\nillustrated in Fig. 1. Synthesis of NO in the chloroplast takes place by\\nNR-basednitritereduction(NiR),wherenitrite(NO\\n2ˉ)isconvertedinto\\nNO. In mitochondria, ETC (electron transport chain)-dependent enzy-\\nmaticnitritereduction(mtNi:NOR)occursusingnitriteassubstrateand\\nNADPH as donor to produce NO. Furthermore, NOS-like activity has\\nbeen suggested for the Arabidopsis thaliana NO-associated protein 1\\n(AtNOA1) (Moreau et al., 2008). However, determining the source ofNOinplantshasbeenchallengingandNOformationinplantcellsisthe\\nsubjectof continuousdebate(Hancock,2012;Salgadoetal.,2013).\\n1.2. Role of NO in drought stress\\nAgricultural practices are significantly affected worldwide by pre-\\nvalent drought due to climate change. Drought is one of the most im-\\nportant plant stresses, causing several physiological, morphological,\\nbiochemical,andmolecularchangesinplants.Moreover,droughtstress\\nnegatively influences plant growth and development (Rahdari andHoseini, 2012; Zlatev and Lidon, 2012), thereby limiting crop pro-ductivity (Lambers et al., 2008). Several studies have reported on the\\nroleofNOduringplantgrowthanddevelopmentundernormalaswell\\nasstressconditionssuchasdrought(Kwonetal.,2012;Santisreeetal.,\\n2015). NO has emerged as an important signaling molecule in plants,\\nactivating ROSscavengingenzymes underabiotic stresses suchas alu-\\nminum (Al), salt (Yu et al., 2014), and drought stress (Kolbert et al.,\\n2005). Plants grown under water-limited conditions undergo various\\nadaptivemechanismstoreducestress,includingextensiverootsystem\\nmodification to enhance water supply, alterations to leaf size or leaf\\nrolling,modificationincuticlepermeability,developingawaxylayeror\\nspongy tissue, and sunken stomata size to avoid water evaporation.\\nThesetoleranceadaptationmechanismsarecommonlyclassifiedas(1)\\ndrought escape, (2) drought recovery, and (3) drought avoidance\\n(Bartels,2005).Mostoftheseadaptationsresultingfromlimitedwater\\nconditions involveNO andsometimes through a symbioticassociation\\nwith rhizobacteria that contribute to the modification of root archi-\\ntecture(Creusetal.,2005).\\nFurthermore,NOhasemergedasvitalelementindroughttolerance\\nof several plant species through enhancing the antioxidant systems,\\nproline, ROS, and osmolytes metabolism (Filippou et al., 2014; Shi\\net al., 2014). NO may also act as mediator to prevent water loss via\\nABA-induced stomatal response through various signaling pathways\\nsuch as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), cyclic guanosine\\nmonophosphate(cGMP)andCa\\n2+(Gayatrietal.,2013).Atmolecular\\nlevel,NOplaysamulti-dimensionalroleindroughtstress.Inresponseto drought, plant exhibit DNA methylation and cause genome-wide\\nalteration.Fan et al. (2012) showed that these cellular changes were\\naffected by NO as shown by exogenous application of SNP. NO-re-\\nsponsivedrought-relatedgenesincludetranscriptionfactors,promoters\\nandantioxidant-relatedgenes(Besson-Bardetal.,2009a,b;Grünetal.,\\n2006; Palmieri et al., 2008). Various studies have reported NO pro-\\nduction following drought stress in different species across the plant\\nkingdom(Table 1).\\n1.2.1. NO mitigates the ROS mediated oxidative stress\\nPlantsnormallyproduceROSasaconsequenceofdroughtorwater\\nstress. This results from a reduction in the photosynthetic rate which\\nalters the electron flow by producing ROS, subsequently leading to\\nwhat is known as an “oxidative burst” (Loggini et al., 1999). Plants\\ncounter the ROS-mediated negative effects by enzymatic and non-en-\\nzymatic mechanisms. Enzymatic mechanisms include catalases (CATs)\\n(Tunc-Ozdemir etal.), peroxidase, and metallothionein scavenging ac-\\ntivity; and non-enzymatic mechanisms include vitamin C, E, glu-\\ntathione,flavonoids,polyamines,andcarotenoids.Plantsareknownto\\naccumulate abscisic acid (ABA) under drought stress, leading toTable1\\nCompilationofreports onNOandSNOgenerationindifferentplantsandplantorgansexposedtodroughtorwater shortage.\\nPlantspecies Experimentalconditions Tissue NO/SNOlevel Reference\\nArabidopsis thaliana Withholding water Leaves ↓ Xieetal.(2014)\\nAilanthus altissima Withholding water Leaves ↑ Filippouetal.(2014)\\nBrassica juncea Growthchamberdehydration Seedlings ↑ Abat andDeswal (2009)\\nCitrus aurantium PEG Leaves ↑ Ziogas etal.(2013)\\nCucumis sativus Withholding water Roots/leave/seedlings ↑ Arasimowicz-Jeloneketal.(2009b,a)\\nGuzmania monostachia PEG Leaves ↑ MiotoandMercier(2013)\\nHordeum vulgare Withholding water Seedling ↑ Montilla-Bascónetal.(2017)\\nMedicago truncatula Withholding water Roots/leave/seedlings ↑ Filippouetal.(2011)\\nOryza sativa PEG/mannitol Leaves ↑ Cai etal.(2015); Xiongetal.(2012)\\nPisum sativum Dehydrationatdry air Seedlings ↑ Leshem andHaramaty(1996)\\nPisum sativum L.

NO can reduce lipid free radicals (R*), superoxide\\nanions (O 2−), and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) when they reach toxic\\nlevels (Hu et al., 2016). Furthermore, NO can mitigate the negative\\neffect of ROS, via lipid peroxidation, encouraging photosynthesis and\\nexpression of antioxidant enzymes through MAPK and other signaling\\npathways(Asaietal.,2008;Shi etal.,2014).Forinstance,SOD,CAT,\\nascorbateperoxidase(APX)dehydroascorbatereductase(DHAR)via S-\\nnitrosylation activities may increase to mitigate oxidative damage\\ncaused by ROS (Shi and Chan, 2014). Moreover, role of NO in the al-\\nleviationofROS-mediatedoxidativestressisestablishedbyimproving\\ncell stability and elasticity through reinforcement of cell phospholipid\\nbilayerandenhancingthefluidityofmembrane,balancingcellularROS\\nlevel and regulating the toxicity (Gan et al., 2015). For instance, in\\ncucumberandricetheexogenousapplicationofNOenhanceddrought\\ntolerance with increased antioxidants, that scavenge ROS\\n(Arasimowicz-Jeloneketal.,2009a; Farooqetal.,2009).\\nFurther in this context, the role of peroxisomes is of particular im-\\nportance. Although peroxisomes are simple organelles, their im-\\nportance in terms of cell viability under basal as well as stress condi-\\ntions is undeniable. In addition to their significant role in ROS\\nmetabolism, these organelles are also an endogenous source of nitric\\noxide (NO) and various other reactive nitrogen species (RNS). At the\\ncellular level NO and H 2O2act as retrograde signals among different\\ncompartments, facilitating cellular adaptation to stress conditions.Interestingly, there is a possibility that parts of this network may be-\\ncome overloaded under nitro-oxidative conditions, causing cellular\\ndamageand/orcelldeath(Corpasetal.,2017).Plantperoxisomeshave\\na dynamic metabolism of ROS and RNS. These molecules affect the\\nfunctionality of target proteins, peptides or fatty acidsvia posttransla-tionalmodifications(Corpasetal.,2019).\\n1.2.2. NO in stomatal movement and defense during drought stress\\nIn water-stressed plant NO plays an important role in stomatal\\nfunctionandtranspirationinwater-stressedplantsresponsetostomatal\\nclosure, ABA induces NO production along with a rise in pH and per-\\noxidelevelsinplantcells(Grecoetal.,2012;Wendehenneetal.,2001).\\nThe role of NO along with other gas transmitters in regulation of leaf\\nand gas interaction with different components of guard cell signaling\\nnetwork, was reviewed by (García-Mata and Lamattina, 2013). Fur-\\nthermore, it has been shown that NO plays a role in stomatal closure\\nstimulated by ABA in Arabidopsis (Neill et al., 2008), which was con-\\nfirmed in the Arabidopsis nia1/nia2 knockout mutant with unchanged\\nstomatal action (Chen et al., 2016). NO-induced stomatal closure and\\nreductionintranspirationhasalsobeendemonstratedinwheatandthe\\nfaba bean (García-Mata and Lamattina, 2001; Santisree et al., 2015)\\nalthough a contrasting report, also in faba beans, indicated that NO\\ninducestomatalopeninginsteadofclosing(García-MataandLamattina,\\n2001). Activation of MAPK signaling cascades drive stomatal closure\\nthrough NO has been also reported in plants (Zhang et al., 2007). Al-\\nthoughplantNOsignalingpathwaysduringdroughtstressremaintobe\\nfully elucidated, NO has been observed to upregulate the levels of\\ncGMP, which activates downstream plant defense genes. Similarly,\\ncyclic adenine dinucleotide phosphate ribose (cADPR), another sec-\\nondary messenger of NO signaling, is also known to activate defense\\ngenes (Sekietal.,2001).\\n1.2.3. ImpactofexogenousandendogenousNOon drought-stressedplants\\nMost plant studies on NO have involved exogenous application of\\nNO donors or inhibitors/scavengers. For instance, the most basic NO\\ndonorsused inplant droughtstressexperiments are sodiumnitroprus-\\nside (SNP), S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), S-ni-\\ntrosoglutathione (GSNO), and diethylamine NONOate sodium (DEA-NONOate). These NO donors are either applied through the roots assupplementsingrowthmedia,injectedintotheleafapoplastorsprayed\\nonto the plants. Growth and yield of plants exposed to stress were\\nrescuedbySNPsupplementation(Farooqetal.,2009).Literatureshows\\nthat exogenous NO can reduce the negative effects of water stress\\n(Farooq et al., 2009; Liao et al., 2012; Rahimian Boogar et al., 2014).\\nExogenous SNP application has been reported for drought stress toler-\\nance (Hao et al., 2008) on drought-stressed hull-less barley seedlings\\ntreated with different concentrations of SNP; the results showed that\\ndroughtstressseriouslyalteredphysiologicalfunctionsandgrowthbut\\nNOapplicationalleviatedthedroughtenduringdamagesbyantioxidant\\nand ROS scavenging enzyme activity (Gan et al., 2015). NO also in-\\nteractswithplanthormonesandvariousothersignalingmolecules,and\\nregulates osmoprotectants that protect against drought stress. In con-\\ntrast, NO scavengers such as L-NAME (NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl\\nester)reduceendogenousNOlevels,leadingtohigherstresssensitivity\\n(Hao et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2010a). Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are\\nproducedunderconditionsofdroughtorwaterstress(Campalansetal.,\\n2001; Swindell et al., 2007) and are involved in protein refolding.\\nHSP70, as well as NO, were observed to protect against oxidized cell\\napoptosis(Mosseretal.,1997).LiteraturesuggestsakeyroleofNOin\\nregulating important physiological events of plants (such as photo-\\nsynthesis, defense against oxidative damage, transcription and post-\\ntranslationalmodifications)underheatstressreviewedby(Parankusam\\net al., 2017). Overall, NO is essential during drought conditions and\\nseveral studies have established that NO is produced in various plant\\ntissues.BothendogenousandexogenousapplicationofNOdonorscan\\nhelp protect plants from oxidative injuries, protein denaturation, and\\nthenegativeimpactonphotosynthesis,aswellasenhanceantioxidant\\nmechanismsandmaintaincellwaterlevelillustrated in(Fig.2).\\nBrassinosteroids (BRs) are important for plant growth, develop-\\nment, and stress responses.

Interestingly, BL-pretreatment induced the production of\\nboth H\\n2O2and NO. Whereas, the application of a brassinazole (BR-in-\\nhibitor)reducedH 2O2andNOproduction(Arfanetal.,2019).Whatis\\nmoreinterestingisthatsuppressionofH 2O2productionbyaninhibitor\\nalso blocks BRs-induced NO production but BR-induced H 2O2produc-\\ntion was not sensitive to NO suppression. Further, the suppression of\\nH2O2and NO production also decreases the expression of BL-induced\\nmitochondrial alternative oxidase (Yanhui et al., 2006) and the pho-tosystem capacity. This indicates that BRs-induced photosystem II ef-\\nficiency is moreNO-dependent thanH\\n2O2(Arfanetal.,2019).

Role of NO in salt stress\\nA global increase in soil salinity threatens plant growth and agri-\\ncultural production (Zhu, 2003). More than 20% of arable land and\\napproximately 50% of irrigated land is affected by salinity stress\\n(Shrivastava and Kumar, 2015). The high saline conditions are dele-\\nterious to plants, inhibiting various biochemical and physiological\\nprocesses(Hasegawaetal.,2000;MunnsandTester,2008).Inaddition,\\nsalt stress normally has a negative effect on ion homeostasis and os-\\nmoticbalanceofplantcells(MunnsandTester,2008).Intracellularion\\nimbalanceinhibitssoilnutrientuptakeleadingtonutritiondeficiencies.\\nFurthermore, salt stress provokes membrane disintegration, loss of\\nmetabolicfunctionionleakage,DNAdefragmentation,andsubsequent\\ncelldeath(Hasegawaetal.,2000).Toamelioratethesenegativeeffects\\nof salt stress, plants have evolved protective mechanisms. These me-\\nchanisms include strategies like modification of the cell membrane,\\nlimiting ion transport to the root, accumulation of specific ions,R.B.S. Nabi, et al. Environmental and Experimental Botany 161 (2019) 120–133\\n123generating counter solute, modification of respiration and photo-\\nsynthesis, promotion of phytohormone synthesis, and induction of\\nsecondarymetabolites.TheNOdonorSNPhasbeenshowntomitigate\\nosmoticstresstoleranceandenhancesseedlinggrowthundersaltstress\\nin several plant species including rice, lupin, and cucumber (Barakat\\netal.,2012;Fanetal.,2007,2013;KopyraandGwóźdź,2003;Uchida\\netal.,2002).Somestudieshavereportedanincreaseindryweightafter\\nNO application under salt stress in maize, and seashore mallow seed-\\nlings (Guo et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2006). In addition, studies have\\ndemonstratedthatNOalsoreleasesthenanoparticleknownaschitosan\\nnanoparticles (CS NPs) which mitigate the toxic effects of salinity in\\nmaize plants(Oliveiraetal.,2016).\\nDespite the importance given to research regarding the functional\\nroleofNOinsaltstressresponses(Baietal.,2011),resultsobtainedare\\nunconvincingduetothedifferentplantspecies,typesoftreatment,and\\nrange of salt concentrations used (Manai et al., 2014).Hence, the me-\\nchanismsbehindtheroleofNOinsaltstressresponsesremainillusive\\ninplantsystems.However,fewpossiblemechanismsarediscussedhere.\\nDifferent studies report molecular details of the adaptive responses of\\nplantstosaltstressinpresenceofexogenousapplicationofNOdonors.\\nPolyamineshaveaknownroleinplantdefensesagainstsaltstress,and\\ntheir induction is known to be closely associated with NO production\\n(Guoetal.,2009).Therefore,NO-polyamineinteractionmayoneofthe\\nmolecular mechanisms for stress tolerance in plants.

Moreover, some dehydrogenase\\nenzymes also play a crucial role in NR-dependent NO production; for\\ninstance, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme was shown to\\nimprove the tolerance of the red kidney bean root to salt stress (Liu\\net al., 2007). In our laboratory, we recently investigated the involve-\\nment of NO in salt stress mitigation in different rice genotypes. We\\nobserved a significant increase in the expression of OsHIPP38, OsGR1,\\nandOsP5CS2in the salt-susceptible rice genotypes under salt stress\\nwhen the seedlings were treated with NO donor SNP, thus giving a\\nresistant response to salt stress. Whereas, plants that were not treated\\nwith NO donor succumbed to salt-stress. Furthermore, SNP-treated\\nplants produced more biomass under salt stress indicating a positive\\nroleofNOundersaltstress(Adamuetal.,2018).\\nLiteratureshowingtheinvolvementofNOinsaltstressmitigationin\\nplants is listed in Table 2. These studies currently available on NO-\\nmediated salt stress tolerance indicates that NO has a pivotal role inalleviating osmotic damage, reducing excessive ROS production in\\ncells, boosting secondary defense mechanisms, and maintaining cell\\npermeability, in addition to being involved in several pathways that\\nprotecttheplantfromsaltstress(Fig.2).Furtherresearchisneededin\\nFig.2.Generalizedmodelofthedynamicrole\\nplayedbynitricoxide(NO)inplantagainstthe\\ndrought, salt, and heavy metal stress.

Role of NO in heavy-metal stress: aluminum toxicity and cadmium-\\ninduced oxidative stress\\nNatural resources have been contaminated by rapid industrial de-\\nvelopment in the last few decades. Increased levels of heavy metals(Ekmekcietal.,2005)affectecosystemsandcausestressandtoxicityin\\nplants, animals, and microorganisms (Kavamura and Esposito, 2011).\\nAsplantsabsorbnutrientsandmineralsfromthesoil(Grennan,2009),\\nheavy metals or non-metals can cause abnormal metabolic changes,\\neven in small quantities. However, how HMs affect the integrity of\\nplants is poorly understood. Plant roots are normally the first tissue\\naffectedbyHM-inducedoxidativestressdamagesincetheyareindirect\\ncontact with the soil. For instance, Alfalfa roots under Cd (Cadmium)\\nand Hg (Mercury) stress showed oxidative and glutathione depletion\\n(Ortega-Villasante et al., 2005). Similarly, a 38% alteration in root\\nlength has recently been observed in Arabidopsis under HM stress\\n(Corpasetal.,2017).ThemorphologicalresponsesinducedbyHMsin\\nvarious plant organs have been reviewed by (Kolbert, 2016). Heavy\\nmetal or metalloid stress can be toxic to plants, inducing notable\\nchangesinplantmorphology,physiology,andcellularandbiochemical\\nfunctions. HMs also negatively impact growth, photosynthesis, re-\\nproduction,antioxidantactivity,asolublecontentofantioxidants,cell\\ndivision,anddifferentiation(SharmaandDietz,2009).Severalstudieshave been conducted to understand how HM stress affects plants and\\nthe mechanisms of recovery from stress (He and Chen, 2014; Kolbert\\netal.,2017;Petoetal.,2013).\\nEndogenousNOaccumulationoccursinresponsetoHMs,although\\nitvarieswithcondition,specificity,andtypeofmetal.Forinstance,in\\nArabidopsis, lead stress resulted in overproduction of NO affectingvarious catalytic reactions in peroxisomes and enhancement of the\\nprimaryandlateralroots(Kolbertetal.,2017).Itisalsointerestingto\\nsee that different studies reporting on heavy metal toxicity and en-\\ndogenous NO production in different plants, have produced contra-\\ndictory results. For instance in soybean, endogenous NO rapidly in-\\ncreases after 72h of heavy metal stress (Kopyra et al., 2006). In\\ncontrast, Rose mallow seedlings under Aluminum stress showed a\\nsudden reduction in endogenous NO level in the roots (Tain et al.,\\n2007). Similarly, there was a significant reduction of endogenous NO\\nlevels in the root of Cd-treated Barrel medic after 48h (Xu et al.,\\n2010a).Thereareseveraladditionalreportsdemonstratingpositiveand\\nnegative changes in NO levels under heavy metal stress; examples in-\\ncludeArabidopsis,soybean,rice,peaandmaizeaswellasseveralother\\nplantspecies(Table4).Theobservedcontradictoryresultsmaybeduetodifferencesinthe typesofHMs,planttissuesexamined,durationof\\nstress, as well as method of NO quantification (Planchet and Kaiser,\\n2006a,2006b).\\nAs a multifunctional gaseous molecule, NO has a vital role in alle-\\nviatingtheHMtoxicityatbothendogenouslevelaswellasexogenous\\napplication. For instance, exogenousNO applicationdemonstrated the\\namelioration of arsenic (As\\n3+) toxicity in rice and mung bean by re-\\nducing ROS and As3+-induced malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (Ismail,\\n2012;Singhetal.,2009).Studiesonwheatandricereportamelioration\\nofHMstressbyapplicationofNO(Mostofaetal.,2014).Recently,the\\nrole of NO in alleviating cadmium stress and improvement in plant\\ngrowthandbiomassyieldhasbeenreportedin Typhaangustifolia (Zhao\\netal.,2016).ThesereportssuggestedtheinvolvementofNOinvariousadaptive mechanisms such as cell wall relaxation, safeguarding phos-\\npholipid bilayer and improving cell wall expansion and overall plant\\ngrowth (Leshem and Haramaty, 1996; Seabra and Oliveira, 2016) in\\nordertotolerateHMstress.OthermechanismsregulatedbyNOinclude\\nmaintenanceofosmoticpressurewhichinturnmaintainstheviscosityTable2\\nDifferent reportsontheroleof NOinplantresponsestosalt stress.\\nPlantmaterial SNPconc.(μM) NaClconc.\\n(mM)Observedeffects Reference\\nAlfalfa(Medicago sativa) 100a100 Improvedthe seedgermination andgrowth WangandHan(2007)\\nBarley(Hordeum vulgare L.) 50a50 Improvedthe antioxidantactivity Lietal.(2008)\\nChickpea(Cicer arietinum L.) 50and100b50and100 Improvedthe growth,osmolytesandanti-oxidantactivity Ahmadetal.(2016)\\nCucumber(Cucumis sativus L.) 100a100 Improvedthe hypocotylsandradiclesgrowth Linetal.(2012)\\nCucumber(Cucumis sativus L) 5000a100 InducedROSscavengersandthreeby reducethe oxidativedamage Shietal.(2007)\\nJatropha (Jatropha curca) 75b100 Improvedthe seedlinggrowthandreducedoxidativedamageand\\ntoxicionaccumulationGomesetal.(2017)\\nLupin(Lupinus luteus L.) 100a200 Improvedrootarchitect,increased activityantioxidantenzymes KopyraandGwóźdź(2003)\\nMaize(Zea mays L.) 100a100 Improvedseedlinggrowth andantioxidantactivity Zhangetal.(2006)\\nMustard(Brassica juncea L.) 200a150 Improvementin theactivitiesof anti-oxidantenzymesandreducedoxidativedamageKhanetal.(2012)\\nPopulus(Populus euphratica calluse) 300\\na150 NapercentagedecreasedandtheK/Naratioincreased incallusesundersaltstressZhangetal.(2007)\\nRedkidneybean(Phaseolusvulgaris) 50\\na100 EnhancedG-6-PDHactivity,endogenousantioxidantenzymesincreasedLiuetal.(2007)\\nRice(Oryza sativa L.) <10\\na0–100 SNPsignificantlyprotectedthericeseedlingsfromdamageby saltstressandincreasedanti-oxidantactivity.Uchidaetal.(2002)\\nSoybean(Glycine max L.) 10\\na80 Increasedanti-oxidantactivity Egbichietal.(2014)\\nSpinach(Spinacia oleracea L.) 200c200 Increasedanti-oxidantactivityandsecondarymetabolites Duetal.(2015)\\nSunflower(Helianthus annuus) 250a120 Improvedseedlinggrowth andantioxidantactivity Kaur andBhatla (2016)\\nSunflower(Helianthus annuus\\nseeds)100,250,500,and1000\\na120 ReducedROScontentin seedlingcotyledonsatlater seedlingstagesandimprovedantioxidantactivityAroraandBhatla(2017)\\nTomato(Solanum lycopersicum L.) 100,and300\\na120 ShowedahighercontentinbothprolineandascorbateandreducedperoxidelevelManaietal.(2014)\\nTomato(Solanum lycopersicum L.) 100\\na75dIncreasedNOS activityandNOcontent Liuetal.(2015a,b)\\nWheat(Triticum aestivum L.) 0or100a300 Increasedcoleoptile andradiclegrowth,anddrybiomass Zhengetal.(2009)\\nWheat(Triticum aestivum) 1a150and300 Improvedanti-oxidantactivityandreducedoxidativedamage Hasanuzzamanetal.(2011)\\nWheat(T. aestivum L.) 100a100 Improvedanti-oxidantactivity,photosynthetic rate Tianetal.(2015)\\naμM.\\nbMolar.\\ncnl/L.\\ndNaHCO3.R.B.S.

Currently there are thirteen  \\nconfirmed mistletoe -oaks in Britain.  V. album  parasiti sing Quercus  spp. mainly occur s \\nat locations in and around Herefordshire in the core of the current and past \\ndistribution of V. album  in Britain . The results of th is recent  survey accord with the \\nearlier review  and with reports in the 19th and early 20th centuries  suggesting that \\nthe population of between ten and twenty Quercus  trees parasiti sed by  V. album  in \\nBritain appears to be relatively stable over time with some losses of host trees and \\ngains from  the parasitism of new trees.  Quercus robur  L. is the most frequent host \\namongst the existing mistletoe -oaks which also include ‘red oaks’ ( Q. rubra  L., Q. \\ncoccinea  Münchh. and Q. palustris  Münchh.) . The estimated ages of the existing \\nQuercus hosts range from 30 to 400 years.  The mistletoe -oaks are located in  \\nwoodland, woodland edges, hedges, parkland, a garden , a churchyard  and open \\ncountryside by a watercourse . \\n \\nKeywords : parasitism ; pedunculate oak ; pin oak; red oak ; scarlet oak ; sessile oak . \\n \\nIntroduction  \\nViscum  album  parasitising  Quercus  robur  and Q. petraea  (Matt.) Liebl.  is an \\nuncommon  association throughout Western Europe ( Tubuef , 1923; Grazi & Urech , \\n1983; pers. comm., Konrad Urech, August 2017 ). France appears to be the \\nexception with mistletoe recorded on 390 indigenous oaks ( Q. robur  & Q. petraea ) \\nand on 463 ‘American oaks’ (Q. coccinea , Q. palustris  , Q. rubra ) (Frochot, Grazi & \\nUrech, 1994 ; Ramm et al., 2000; Urech , 2008). At many locations  in France , either \\nV. album  has disappeared from the oak  tree or the tree is no longer present  and \\ncurrently there are about 245  indigenous oak trees with V. album  (pers. comm., \\nKonrad Urech, August 2017).  \\nIn Britain, Quercus  spp. have always been a rare host for V album  (Evelyn , \\n1664; Ray , 1677; Withering , 1796; Loudon , 1838; Bull , 1907; Tubuef , 1923; \\nNicholson , 1932; Perring , 1973).  The current and historical status of Quercus  with V. \\nalbum  in Britain w as reported by Box (2000) based on a comprehensive survey from \\n1996 to 1998 involving  the published literature, county floras, herbaria, the40 \\n Biological Records Centre and local records centres , the County R ecorders of the \\nBotanical Society of Britain & Irela nd (BSBI)  and site visits .  \\n \\nMethods  \\nAdditional information to that given in Box (2000) was sought in various ways and \\nconfirmed by  visits to specific  locations. Requests for information were circulated to \\nenvironmental and biological records centres in Great Britain in August 2017 by the \\nAssociation of Local Environmental Records Centres (ALERC)  and to the BSBI C ounty \\nRecorders through the BSBI eNews  in January 2018  (http://bsbi.org/wp -\\ncontent/uploads/dlm_uploads/BSBI -eNews -January -2018.pdf ). Wide circulation \\nabout th is was achieved through the BSBI News & Views blog  \\n(http://bsbipublicity.blogspot.com/2018/01/mistletoe -growing -on-oak.html ) and via \\nthe BSBI Twitter account  (https://twitter.com/BSBIbot any) during January 2018.  \\nThe original eleven Quercus  trees with V. albu m recorded by Box (2000) and \\nthe additional trees identified  by ALERC and the county botanical recorders were \\nvisited in winter months between October  2017 and December  2018 (in some cases \\nmore than once in different months) . The presence or absence of V. album  berries \\nfrom a visual inspection using 12 x 25 binoculars  determine d if the plant was female \\n(Fig. 1) or was assumed to be male (confirmation would have require d a careful \\ninspection of flowers) . The girth of each of the additional Quercus  trees supporting \\nV. album  was measured at 1.3 m above ground level and used to derive the \\ndiameter at breast height (dbh) from which th e age of each tree was estimated  \\ntaking into  account the species,  location and habitat  (White , 1998, Table 1a ).  \\n \\n \\nFigure 1 .

Three large female \\nbunches  growing on branches at approximately  2 m and 3m above ground level.  \\nWorcestershire ( v.c. 37) & Shropshire (v.c. 40) \\nBewdley  Three historical r eports on the north bank of the Dowles Brook at \\nBewdley were noted by Box (2000) . A visit to the location in December 1996 found  \\nthat there was no V. album present  on this Quercus  tree. Another visit in July 2017 \\nconfirmed the absence of  V. album on this Quercus  and on the very old pollarded \\nQuercus  opposite on the south bank of Dowles Brook. The location of the Quercus  \\non the north bank was ascribed by Box  (2000) t o Worcestershire ( v.c. 37) although \\nit should be Shropshire (v.c. 40) following a close examination of the boundary \\nbetween the two vice counties (the vice -county boundary tool \\nhttp://www.cucaera.co.uk/grp/  on the BSBI website www. bsbi.org/maps -and-data). \\nStaffordshire ( v.c. 39) \\nArley  Rea ( 1923) report s V. album on Q. rubra  at Arley Castle.  A report  of V. \\nalbum on one Q. rubra  in Worcestershire by Maskew (2014) is based on data from a \\nfield meeting of the Wyre Forest Study Group to Arley Castle in January 2013 ( pers. \\ncomms., John Hawksford, August 2017  and Brett Westwood, September 2017 ). \\nArley Castle is in the administrative county of Worcestershire but in v.c. 39 \\nStaffordshire.  My visit s in November 2017 and February 2018 found no V. album on \\nthe Q. rubra  at the reported locations.  \\nShropshire ( v.c. 40) \\nHughley  My visit in January 2018 to the location (National Grid Reference SO \\n565966) of a field named as ‘Mizzletoe Oak’ on the map redrawn by HDG Foxall  in \\n1977 from the 1839 tithe map and apportionment of Hughley parish in Shropshire \\n(held by Shropshire Archives, Shrewsbury)  found that the hedges have been altered \\nand that no V. album was growing on the nearby  Quercus  trees. \\nNottinghamshire ( v.c. 56) \\nWallingwells  Under the heading ‘Unknown locations’, Box (2000) noted a \\nreport of three V. album  plants on Quercus  seen by Thomas Knowlton in August \\n1765 on the estate of …. White Esq. at Watling Wells (Dillwyn 1843) but this location \\ncould not be identified . Further research  revealed a n earlier  account by Thomas \\nKnowlton in a letter dated 20 January 1741 of V. album growing on Quercus  that \\nrefers to  Walling Wells  (Henrey 1986) , now known as Wallingwells, near Worksop .45 \\n Enquiries of Carlton in Lindrick Parish Council and Woodsetts Local History Society in \\n2017 and my visit to one potential location in February 2018  produced no positive \\nresults.  \\nSouth -west Yorkshire ( v.c. 63) \\nSheffield  V. album reported growing on a young planted Quercus  in February \\n2017 (Sheffield Biological Records Centre). Tree confirmed as Q. palustris  from \\nleaves in October 2017 (pers. comm., Michael Senkans, Parks & Countryside Service, \\nSheffield City Council).  \\nVisit on 20 January 2018 : Young Q. palustris  growing in a park. The dbh is 26 \\ncm at 1.3 m and the estimated age is around 30 years ( 26-33 years). One female \\nbunch of V. album with berries growing on top of a lower branch in the angle with \\nthe trunk at approximately 3 m above ground level.  \\n \\nDiscussion  \\nA further four Quercus  trees parasiti sed by V. album (Fig. 2) have been identified \\nduring 2017  and 2018  in addition to th e eleven parasiti sed trees recorded by Box \\n(2000)  between 1996  and 1998 . Of these original eleven trees, one ha s been felled \\n(Putley)  and one ha s lost the branch supporting V. album (Stretton Sugwas ). There \\nwere more bunches of V. album growing  on the trees at Bredwardine, Leintwardine \\nand Windsor  than were reported in 2000 . There are  now thirteen  Quercu s trees \\nparasitised by  V. album in Britain.  \\n \\n \\nFigure 2 . A straggly bunch of V. album  parasiti sing Q. robur  \\n \\nThe four recently recorded Quercus  trees with V. album are growing in open \\nsituations (hedgerow, woodland edge, urban park, garden)  which is consistent with \\nthose reported by Box (2000) . The lower end of the age range of the original set of \\neleven trees (90 to 400 years) has been reduced to around 30 years, at least for red46 \\n oaks, because of the new records at Huddington and Sheffield.  The age of the V. \\nalbum cannot be reliably estimated and the date of initial parasitism is unknown.  \\nViscum  album is dioecious. Box (2000) reported that the V. album on three \\nQuercus  trees (Brampton Bryan, Gwehelog, Windsor) was recorded as ‘probably \\nmale’ because of the absence of berries in visits during November to February. \\nThere were no V. album berries visible on the tree at Gwehelog in November 2017 \\nand the V. album is once again assumed to be male. However, berries were clearly \\nvisible on various parts of the V. album growing on Quercus  at Brampton Bryan and \\nat Windsor in November 2017, although no berries were visible on the previous  visits \\nto the Quercus  trees at Brampton Bryan (December 1996, December 1998) and at \\nWindsor (January 1997, November  1998) (Box 2000). This suggests that the V. \\nalbum plants at both Brampton Bryan and Windsor are female but may lie at \\nsufficient distance from the nearest male V. album that pollination does not always \\noccur.  \\nThe V. album on the Quercus  at Deerfold is notable because it has a very long \\nrecorded history. Bull (1869) includes a sketch of a bunch of V. album on a tree \\nwithout leaves in March 1 869 together with  a description  of it growing on a main \\nstem of the tree after it has bifurcated ; Anon. (1930) reports the V. album growing \\nin the same location ; a record from the national Biological Records Centre states \\n\"Extinct c. 1963\" ; Tonkin (1984)  report ed that the V. album was no lon ger there ; \\nBox (2000) record ed a bunch of V. album in 1996 on the west side of the western of \\nthe two main trunks which divided at about 6.5m above ground level; there was a \\nreport by Jonathan Briggs  of no visible V. album in February 2011 \\n(https://mistletoematters.wordpress.com/2011/02/25/mistletoe -oaks-revisited/ ); my \\nvisits in November 2017 and February 2018 found no bunch of V. album but there \\nwere at least two short mature stems with clean cut ends and three small, young \\ngrowths (Fig. 3) growing in the same position  on the trunk as that depicted by Bull \\n(1869). V. album has been recorded since 1 869 growing in the same position on one \\nof the two main stems or trunks of this tree, but the V. album was no t present as a \\nbunch around 1963, in 1984 , in 2011  and was only present as small plants in winter \\n2017/18. Natural  processes may have been involved (such as death or being blown \\noff in a storm) , but the recent evidence of cut ends to the main stems strongly \\nsuggests that the V. album was harvested by humans . V. album regrows as \\nadventitious shoots from endophytic haustoria ( Harley , 1863, page 185 ; Zuber , \\n2004, pages 182 -183). The past reports of an absence of  V. album may have been \\ndue to small, young regrowths not being visible from the ground.   \\nFull descriptions of the locations of Quercu s with V. album  are not given in this \\npaper because there have been financial offers to reveal such locations, especially \\non indigenous oaks ( Q. robur and Q. petraea ). V. album is claimed to be an \\nalternative therapy for cancer (for example, Mistletoe Therapy UK, \\nhttp://www.mistletoetherapy.org.uk/ ) and is one of the most widely studied \\ncomplementary and alternative medicine  therapies  for cancer  (for example, National \\nCancer Unit, USA, https://www.cancer.gov/about -\\ncancer/treatment/cam/patient/mistletoe -pdq). V. album has been tested extensively \\nas a treatment for cancer, but randomised controlled trials fail to show benefit (Ernst \\n2006).47 \\n \\n \\nFigure 3 . Mature V. album  stems that have been cut and small adventitious \\nshoots on the Deerfold tree  \\n \\nQuercus  trees supporting V. album mainly occur in and around Herefordshire in \\nthe core of the current and past distribution of V. album in Britain ( National \\nBiodiversity Network Atlas \\nhttps://spatial.nbnatlas.org/?q=lsid%3ANBNSYS0000003624 ; Briggs , 2011, page 24, \\nFig. 1; Perring 1973, page 143, Fig . 7). This geographical distribution has not yet \\nbeen fully explained although climatic factors are  considered to be very important in \\nthe di stribution of V. album (Iversen , 1944; Perring , 1973; Briggs , 1991; Zuber , \\n2004). It is interesting to note that this core area is associated with the river basin \\ndistrict of the lower part of the river Severn  (Environment Agency, 2016, page 12 & \\nFig. 1) and this apparent association would merit further investigation.  \\nThe results of the 2017 /18 survey of V. album parasiti sing Quercus  accord with \\nthe conclusion of Box (2000) , based on field data  from 1996 -1998 and reports in the \\nl9th and early 20th centuries , that there is a population of between ten and twenty \\nQuercus trees with V. album in Britain . This population appears to be relatively \\nstable over time with some losses of host trees (or branches ) with V. album and \\ngains from the parasitism of new Quercus  trees.  \\n \\nAcknowledgements  \\nI am very grateful to Dr. Konrad Urech (Verein für Krebsforschung, Arlesheim, \\nSwitzerland) for many useful exchanges of information about mistletoe on oaks in \\nBritain and Europe.

Currently there are thirteen  \\nconfirmed mistletoe -oaks in Britain.  V. album  parasiti sing Quercus  spp. mainly occur s \\nat locations in and around Herefordshire in the core of the current and past \\ndistribution of V. album  in Britain . The results of th is recent  survey accord with the \\nearlier review  and with reports in the 19th and early 20th centuries  suggesting that \\nthe population of between ten and twenty Quercus  trees parasiti sed by  V. album  in \\nBritain appears to be relatively stable over time with some losses of host trees and \\ngains from  the parasitism of new trees.  Quercus robur  L. is the most frequent host \\namongst the existing mistletoe -oaks which also include ‘red oaks’ ( Q. rubra  L., Q. \\ncoccinea  Münchh. and Q. palustris  Münchh.) . The estimated ages of the existing \\nQuercus hosts range from 30 to 400 years.  The mistletoe -oaks are located in  \\nwoodland, woodland edges, hedges, parkland, a garden , a churchyard  and open \\ncountryside by a watercourse . \\n \\nKeywords : parasitism ; pedunculate oak ; pin oak; red oak ; scarlet oak ; sessile oak . \\n \\nIntroduction  \\nViscum  album  parasitising  Quercus  robur  and Q. petraea  (Matt.) Liebl.  is an \\nuncommon  association throughout Western Europe ( Tubuef , 1923; Grazi & Urech , \\n1983; pers. comm., Konrad Urech, August 2017 ). France appears to be the \\nexception with mistletoe recorded on 390 indigenous oaks ( Q. robur  & Q. petraea ) \\nand on 463 ‘American oaks’ (Q. coccinea , Q. palustris  , Q. rubra ) (Frochot, Grazi & \\nUrech, 1994 ; Ramm et al., 2000; Urech , 2008). At many locations  in France , either \\nV. album  has disappeared from the oak  tree or the tree is no longer present  and \\ncurrently there are about 245  indigenous oak trees with V. album  (pers. comm., \\nKonrad Urech, August 2017).  \\nIn Britain, Quercus  spp. have always been a rare host for V album  (Evelyn , \\n1664; Ray , 1677; Withering , 1796; Loudon , 1838; Bull , 1907; Tubuef , 1923; \\nNicholson , 1932; Perring , 1973).  The current and historical status of Quercus  with V. \\nalbum  in Britain w as reported by Box (2000) based on a comprehensive survey from \\n1996 to 1998 involving  the published literature, county floras, herbaria, the40 \\n Biological Records Centre and local records centres , the County R ecorders of the \\nBotanical Society of Britain & Irela nd (BSBI)  and site visits .  \\n \\nMethods  \\nAdditional information to that given in Box (2000) was sought in various ways and \\nconfirmed by  visits to specific  locations. Requests for information were circulated to \\nenvironmental and biological records centres in Great Britain in August 2017 by the \\nAssociation of Local Environmental Records Centres (ALERC)  and to the BSBI C ounty \\nRecorders through the BSBI eNews  in January 2018  (http://bsbi.org/wp -\\ncontent/uploads/dlm_uploads/BSBI -eNews -January -2018.pdf ). Wide circulation \\nabout th is was achieved through the BSBI News & Views blog  \\n(http://bsbipublicity.blogspot.com/2018/01/mistletoe -growing -on-oak.html ) and via \\nthe BSBI Twitter account  (https://twitter.com/BSBIbot any) during January 2018.  \\nThe original eleven Quercus  trees with V. albu m recorded by Box (2000) and \\nthe additional trees identified  by ALERC and the county botanical recorders were \\nvisited in winter months between October  2017 and December  2018 (in some cases \\nmore than once in different months) . The presence or absence of V. album  berries \\nfrom a visual inspection using 12 x 25 binoculars  determine d if the plant was female \\n(Fig. 1) or was assumed to be male (confirmation would have require d a careful \\ninspection of flowers) . The girth of each of the additional Quercus  trees supporting \\nV. album  was measured at 1.3 m above ground level and used to derive the \\ndiameter at breast height (dbh) from which th e age of each tree was estimated  \\ntaking into  account the species,  location and habitat  (White , 1998, Table 1a ).  \\n \\n \\nFigure 1 .

The location of the Quercus  \\non the north bank was ascribed by Box  (2000) t o Worcestershire ( v.c. 37) although \\nit should be Shropshire (v.c. 40) following a close examination of the boundary \\nbetween the two vice counties (the vice -county boundary tool \\nhttp://www.cucaera.co.uk/grp/  on the BSBI website www. bsbi.org/maps -and-data). \\nStaffordshire ( v.c. 39) \\nArley  Rea ( 1923) report s V. album on Q. rubra  at Arley Castle.

Further research  revealed a n earlier  account by Thomas \\nKnowlton in a letter dated 20 January 1741 of V. album growing on Quercus  that \\nrefers to  Walling Wells  (Henrey 1986) , now known as Wallingwells, near Worksop .45 \\n Enquiries of Carlton in Lindrick Parish Council and Woodsetts Local History Society in \\n2017 and my visit to one potential location in February 2018  produced no positive \\nresults.  \\nSouth -west Yorkshire ( v.c. 63) \\nSheffield  V. album reported growing on a young planted Quercus  in February \\n2017 (Sheffield Biological Records Centre).

The dbh is 26 \\ncm at 1.3 m and the estimated age is around 30 years ( 26-33 years).

Of these original eleven trees, one ha s been felled \\n(Putley)  and one ha s lost the branch supporting V. album (Stretton Sugwas ). There \\nwere more bunches of V. album growing  on the trees at Bredwardine, Leintwardine \\nand Windsor  than were reported in 2000 . There are  now thirteen  Quercu s trees \\nparasitised by  V. album in Britain.  \\n \\n \\nFigure 2 . A straggly bunch of V. album  parasiti sing Q. robur  \\n \\nThe four recently recorded Quercus  trees with V. album are growing in open \\nsituations (hedgerow, woodland edge, urban park, garden)  which is consistent with \\nthose reported by Box (2000) . The lower end of the age range of the original set of \\neleven trees (90 to 400 years) has been reduced to around 30 years, at least for red46 \\n oaks, because of the new records at Huddington and Sheffield.  The age of the V. \\nalbum cannot be reliably estimated and the date of initial parasitism is unknown.  \\nViscum  album is dioecious. Box (2000) reported that the V. album on three \\nQuercus  trees (Brampton Bryan, Gwehelog, Windsor) was recorded as ‘probably \\nmale’ because of the absence of berries in visits during November to February. \\nThere were no V. album berries visible on the tree at Gwehelog in November 2017 \\nand the V. album is once again assumed to be male. However, berries were clearly \\nvisible on various parts of the V. album growing on Quercus  at Brampton Bryan and \\nat Windsor in November 2017, although no berries were visible on the previous  visits \\nto the Quercus  trees at Brampton Bryan (December 1996, December 1998) and at \\nWindsor (January 1997, November  1998) (Box 2000). This suggests that the V. \\nalbum plants at both Brampton Bryan and Windsor are female but may lie at \\nsufficient distance from the nearest male V. album that pollination does not always \\noccur.  \\nThe V. album on the Quercus  at Deerfold is notable because it has a very long \\nrecorded history. Bull (1869) includes a sketch of a bunch of V. album on a tree \\nwithout leaves in March 1 869 together with  a description  of it growing on a main \\nstem of the tree after it has bifurcated ; Anon. (1930) reports the V. album growing \\nin the same location ; a record from the national Biological Records Centre states \\n\"Extinct c. 1963\" ; Tonkin (1984)  report ed that the V. album was no lon ger there ; \\nBox (2000) record ed a bunch of V. album in 1996 on the west side of the western of \\nthe two main trunks which divided at about 6.5m above ground level; there was a \\nreport by Jonathan Briggs  of no visible V. album in February 2011 \\n(https://mistletoematters.wordpress.com/2011/02/25/mistletoe -oaks-revisited/ ); my \\nvisits in November 2017 and February 2018 found no bunch of V. album but there \\nwere at least two short mature stems with clean cut ends and three small, young \\ngrowths (Fig. 3) growing in the same position  on the trunk as that depicted by Bull \\n(1869). V. album has been recorded since 1 869 growing in the same position on one \\nof the two main stems or trunks of this tree, but the V. album was no t present as a \\nbunch around 1963, in 1984 , in 2011  and was only present as small plants in winter \\n2017/18. Natural  processes may have been involved (such as death or being blown \\noff in a storm) , but the recent evidence of cut ends to the main stems strongly \\nsuggests that the V. album was harvested by humans . V. album regrows as \\nadventitious shoots from endophytic haustoria ( Harley , 1863, page 185 ; Zuber , \\n2004, pages 182 -183). The past reports of an absence of  V. album may have been \\ndue to small, young regrowths not being visible from the ground.   \\nFull descriptions of the locations of Quercu s with V. album  are not given in this \\npaper because there have been financial offers to reveal such locations, especially \\non indigenous oaks ( Q. robur and Q. petraea ). V. album is claimed to be an \\nalternative therapy for cancer (for example, Mistletoe Therapy UK, \\nhttp://www.mistletoetherapy.org.uk/ ) and is one of the most widely studied \\ncomplementary and alternative medicine  therapies  for cancer  (for example, National \\nCancer Unit, USA, https://www.cancer.gov/about -\\ncancer/treatment/cam/patient/mistletoe -pdq). V. album has been tested extensively \\nas a treatment for cancer, but randomised controlled trials fail to show benefit (Ernst \\n2006).47 \\n \\n \\nFigure 3 . Mature V. album  stems that have been cut and small adventitious \\nshoots on the Deerfold tree  \\n \\nQuercus  trees supporting V. album mainly occur in and around Herefordshire in \\nthe core of the current and past distribution of V. album in Britain ( National \\nBiodiversity Network Atlas \\nhttps://spatial.nbnatlas.org/?q=lsid%3ANBNSYS0000003624 ; Briggs , 2011, page 24, \\nFig. 1; Perring 1973, page 143, Fig . 7). This geographical distribution has not yet \\nbeen fully explained although climatic factors are  considered to be very important in \\nthe di stribution of V. album (Iversen , 1944; Perring , 1973; Briggs , 1991; Zuber , \\n2004). It is interesting to note that this core area is associated with the river basin \\ndistrict of the lower part of the river Severn  (Environment Agency, 2016, page 12 & \\nFig. 1) and this apparent association would merit further investigation.  \\nThe results of the 2017 /18 survey of V. album parasiti sing Quercus  accord with \\nthe conclusion of Box (2000) , based on field data  from 1996 -1998 and reports in the \\nl9th and early 20th centuries , that there is a population of between ten and twenty \\nQuercus trees with V. album in Britain . This population appears to be relatively \\nstable over time with some losses of host trees (or branches ) with V. album and \\ngains from the parasitism of new Quercus  trees.  \\n \\nAcknowledgements  \\nI am very grateful to Dr. Konrad Urech (Verein für Krebsforschung, Arlesheim, \\nSwitzerland) for many useful exchanges of information about mistletoe on oaks in \\nBritain and Europe.

Introduction\\nIn their natural ecosystem plants are usually under stress due to\\ndifferent biotic (pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses) and\\nabiotic factors (environmental: drought, salt, flood, heat, cold, and\\nmetals) that can affect normal growth, development, and yield, con-\\nsequently affecting global food security. Understanding how plants\\nsense and respond to stress signals is a key research question askedin\\nthe backdropofclimate changeandfoodsecurity.In response to stress, plants undergo changes in gene regulation,\\nmetabolism, and physiology. Plants typically respond to abiotic stressby producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Jaspers and Kangasjärvi,\\n2010); however, ROS are potentially toxic, being either harmful or\\nbeneficial to plant cells depending on the concentration (Miller et al.,\\n2010).

NO also has a role in re-\\nspiratory function, namely electron transport pathways in mitochon-\\ndria, where it modulates ROS thereby activating defense mechanisms\\nthroughenhancedantioxidantproductioninplantsexposedtovarious\\nabioticstresses(Zottinietal.,2002).Additionally,exogenoussupplyof\\nNO leads to activation of antioxidant enzymes, especially superoxide\\ndismutase,and restrictssuperoxide anionand lipidO\\n2and organicra-\\ndicals (R) (Shi et al., 2007). However, NO was also shown to be anendogenous modulator of several plant hormones, in addition to in-\\nhibiting the induced programmed cell death and aiding in stomatal\\nfunction in several plant species such as Arabidopsis, wheat, and pea\\n(Bright et al., 2006; Leshem and Haramaty, 1996; Mata, 2001). NOprovokes a wide range of physiological responses in plants, including\\ngermination, development, flowering, senescence, and abiotic stress.\\nMoreover, NO possesses several additional properties favorable to ac-\\ntivity as a signaling messenger during unfavorable or multiple stress\\nconditions such as the presence of free radical, small size redox mole-\\ncules,neutral,andeasilydiffusiblethroughacellmembrane,allthese\\nmake it a very significant agent to act as a dynamic molecule\\n(Domingosetal.,2015).NOisknowntointeractdirectlyorindirectly\\nwith a wide range of targets, leading to altered gene expression and\\nprotein function and thereby affecting the phenotypic response. NO-\\nmediated stress responses and the underlying mechanisms have beenextensively studied by several scientists (Spoel and Loake, 2011; Yuet al., 2012), though with variable results due to the use of different\\napproaches (Ahmad et al., 2016; Begara-Morales et al., 2014; Manaietal.,2014).VariationsinendogenousNOlevelsandorexogenousNO\\napplication has shown to regulate abiotic stress resistance suggesting\\nthatthisapproachmaycontributeinenhancingcropproductionunder\\nstress conditions (Ahmad et al., 2018; Farooq et al., 2009; Siddiqui\\net al., 2011). However, a greater understanding is needed of the mo-\\nlecular mechanisms through which NO directly or indirectly mitigates\\nthe adverse effects of abiotic stress. In this article, we review and dis-\\ncuss the role of NO with regard to exogenous application and en-\\ndogenous synthesis in increasing plant stress tolerance related specifi-\\ncallytodrought,salt,andheavymetalstress.Inaddition,weassessNO-\\nmediatedpost-translationalmodificationsinplants.\\n1.1. Source and synthesis of NO in plants\\nInplants,NOisknownasamultifunctionalbioactivemoleculeand\\nplays an important role as a regulator of plant physiology, disease re-\\nsistance, and stress tolerance (Wang et al., 2010a). Endogenous NO\\nsynthesiscanoccurinstressedorgansorcellsandNOdiffusesintra-as\\nwell as intercellularly (Fröhlich and Durner, 2011). In plants, NO\\nsynthesis was first reported decades ago in legumes, i.e., soybean, bysynthetic inhibitor herbicides as well as under dark anaerobic condi-\\ntions (Klepper, 1991, 1979; Nishimura, 1986). Although, several stu-\\ndiesreportedNOsynthesisinplants,theexactenzymaticsourceofNO\\nis yet to be fully elucidated. Rather, the scientific community now\\nagrees on several oxidative and reductive routes discovered for NO\\nsynthesis in plants. Determining the exact mechanism of NO synthesis\\nFig.1.SchematicdiagramshowingthemajorsourcesofNOandthedifferentmechanismsinvolvedinNOsynthesis.(1)Plasmamembrane:NOsynthesisoccursvia\\nnitratereductase(NR)-basednitrateornitritesubstrate(PM-NR/NiNOR)reductiontoNOthroughreductionpathways,andacidicpHconvertsNO−\\n2toNOandO 2.\\n(2) Chloroplast: NO synthesis occurs both by reduction and oxidation reactions; NR-based reduction produces NO, NOSLE activity (Nitric oxide synthase-like\\nenzyme)-basedNOsynthesisoccursusingL-arginineasasubstrateinthepresenceofNADPH.However,thepathwaysarenotknowninplants.(3)Mitochondria:\\nreduction and oxidation reactions produce NO via complexes I to IV, using NR-based nitrite as a substrate (Mit-NiOR) and in an NADPH-dependent process, L-\\narginineisconvertedtoL-citrullinethroughNOSLEactivitytoproduceNO.(4)Peroxisomes:reductionofNO 2ˉbyXORinanNADPH-dependentreaction,oxidation\\nof L-arg/ctir through NOSLE activity in an NADPH-dependent reaction using Ca2+/Calmodulin as substrates. (5) Apoplast: root-specific NO release; a different\\nmechanism of apoplastic nitrate substrate reduction leads to NO production (Bethke, 2004). (6) Cytoplasm: NO synthesis occurs by both reduction and oxidation\\nreactions; NO−3 is reduced to NO−\\n2in an NADPH-dependent manner, polyamine and hydroxylamine are also oxidized to produce NO but the exact molecular\\nmechanismsareunknown.NOmayalsobeproducedbyanunknownsourcefromGSHtoNOtoGSNOviaaglutathione-basedpathway(modifiedfrom Sahayand\\nGupta,2017).R.B.S. Nabi, et al. Environmental and Experimental Botany 161 (2019) 120–133\\n121andhowitisregulatedinplantsiscomplicatedbytheexistenceofsuch\\nseveral possible mechanisms of NO synthesis. Some studies have in-\\ndicated that NO synthesis may occur in response to biotic as well as\\nabioticstresscausedbysalinity,drought,cold,andheavymetal(Gould\\netal.,2003;Sunetal.,2012;Tanetal.,2012).Ontheotherhand,NO\\nsynthesis in animalshas been well documented.NOis bio-synthesized\\nthroughtheactivityoftheenzymeNOsynthase(NOS),threeisoforms\\nofwhichhavebeenidentifiedinanimals:endothelial(eNOS),neuronal\\n(nNOS), and inducible (iNOS) (Alderton et al., 2001). Of these, the\\nearlier two forms eNOS and nNOS are constitutively expressed to\\nmaintain a certain basal level of NO in animal cells. Whereas, iNOS is\\ninduced under different stressed conditions to enhance NO biosynth-\\nesis. However, NO synthesis in plants appears to be a more complex\\nprocessandtodate,noenzymewithsimilaractivityhasbeenidentified\\nin plants. Furthermore, approximately eight major oxidative and re-\\nductivepathwayshavebeenidentifiedinplantsthatarethoughttobe\\ninvolved in NO biosynthesis (Crawford and Guo, 2005). Oxidative\\npathways include oxidation of (1) L-arginine by NOS-like enzyme, (2)\\npolyamines, and (3) hydroxylamine, whereas reductive pathways in-\\nclude nitrite reduction of: (4) nitrate reductase (NR), (5) plasma\\nmembrane-bound nitrite: NO reductase, (6) xanthine oxidoreductase\\n(XOR), (7) cytochrome-c oxidase and/or reductase, and (8) non-enzy-\\nmaticreductionofnitriteunderacidicconditions(nitriteisprotonated\\nto form nitrous acid (HNO 2) in a freely reversible reaction that is oc-\\ncurred at low pH). The source of origin and various NO-related me-chanisms have been well explained [reviewed by (Gupta et al., 2011;\\nKhan, 2013; Procházková et al., 2014)]. An overview of the potential\\nsources of plant NO production in the chloroplast, peroxisome, mi-\\ntochondria, cytoplasm, plasma membrane, apoplast, and unknown is\\nillustrated in Fig. 1. Synthesis of NO in the chloroplast takes place by\\nNR-basednitritereduction(NiR),wherenitrite(NO\\n2ˉ)isconvertedinto\\nNO. In mitochondria, ETC (electron transport chain)-dependent enzy-\\nmaticnitritereduction(mtNi:NOR)occursusingnitriteassubstrateand\\nNADPH as donor to produce NO. Furthermore, NOS-like activity has\\nbeen suggested for the Arabidopsis thaliana NO-associated protein 1\\n(AtNOA1) (Moreau et al., 2008). However, determining the source ofNOinplantshasbeenchallengingandNOformationinplantcellsisthe\\nsubjectof continuousdebate(Hancock,2012;Salgadoetal.,2013).\\n1.2. Role of NO in drought stress\\nAgricultural practices are significantly affected worldwide by pre-\\nvalent drought due to climate change. Drought is one of the most im-\\nportant plant stresses, causing several physiological, morphological,\\nbiochemical,andmolecularchangesinplants.Moreover,droughtstress\\nnegatively influences plant growth and development (Rahdari andHoseini, 2012; Zlatev and Lidon, 2012), thereby limiting crop pro-ductivity (Lambers et al., 2008). Several studies have reported on the\\nroleofNOduringplantgrowthanddevelopmentundernormalaswell\\nasstressconditionssuchasdrought(Kwonetal.,2012;Santisreeetal.,\\n2015). NO has emerged as an important signaling molecule in plants,\\nactivating ROSscavengingenzymes underabiotic stresses suchas alu-\\nminum (Al), salt (Yu et al., 2014), and drought stress (Kolbert et al.,\\n2005). Plants grown under water-limited conditions undergo various\\nadaptivemechanismstoreducestress,includingextensiverootsystem\\nmodification to enhance water supply, alterations to leaf size or leaf\\nrolling,modificationincuticlepermeability,developingawaxylayeror\\nspongy tissue, and sunken stomata size to avoid water evaporation.\\nThesetoleranceadaptationmechanismsarecommonlyclassifiedas(1)\\ndrought escape, (2) drought recovery, and (3) drought avoidance\\n(Bartels,2005).Mostoftheseadaptationsresultingfromlimitedwater\\nconditions involveNO andsometimes through a symbioticassociation\\nwith rhizobacteria that contribute to the modification of root archi-\\ntecture(Creusetal.,2005).\\nFurthermore,NOhasemergedasvitalelementindroughttolerance\\nof several plant species through enhancing the antioxidant systems,\\nproline, ROS, and osmolytes metabolism (Filippou et al., 2014; Shi\\net al., 2014). NO may also act as mediator to prevent water loss via\\nABA-induced stomatal response through various signaling pathways\\nsuch as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), cyclic guanosine\\nmonophosphate(cGMP)andCa\\n2+(Gayatrietal.,2013).Atmolecular\\nlevel,NOplaysamulti-dimensionalroleindroughtstress.Inresponseto drought, plant exhibit DNA methylation and cause genome-wide\\nalteration.Fan et al. (2012) showed that these cellular changes were\\naffected by NO as shown by exogenous application of SNP. NO-re-\\nsponsivedrought-relatedgenesincludetranscriptionfactors,promoters\\nandantioxidant-relatedgenes(Besson-Bardetal.,2009a,b;Grünetal.,\\n2006; Palmieri et al., 2008). Various studies have reported NO pro-\\nduction following drought stress in different species across the plant\\nkingdom(Table 1).\\n1.2.1. NO mitigates the ROS mediated oxidative stress\\nPlantsnormallyproduceROSasaconsequenceofdroughtorwater\\nstress. This results from a reduction in the photosynthetic rate which\\nalters the electron flow by producing ROS, subsequently leading to\\nwhat is known as an “oxidative burst” (Loggini et al., 1999). Plants\\ncounter the ROS-mediated negative effects by enzymatic and non-en-\\nzymatic mechanisms. Enzymatic mechanisms include catalases (CATs)\\n(Tunc-Ozdemir etal.), peroxidase, and metallothionein scavenging ac-\\ntivity; and non-enzymatic mechanisms include vitamin C, E, glu-\\ntathione,flavonoids,polyamines,andcarotenoids.Plantsareknownto\\naccumulate abscisic acid (ABA) under drought stress, leading toTable1\\nCompilationofreports onNOandSNOgenerationindifferentplantsandplantorgansexposedtodroughtorwater shortage.\\nPlantspecies Experimentalconditions Tissue NO/SNOlevel Reference\\nArabidopsis thaliana Withholding water Leaves ↓ Xieetal.(2014)\\nAilanthus altissima Withholding water Leaves ↑ Filippouetal.(2014)\\nBrassica juncea Growthchamberdehydration Seedlings ↑ Abat andDeswal (2009)\\nCitrus aurantium PEG Leaves ↑ Ziogas etal.(2013)\\nCucumis sativus Withholding water Roots/leave/seedlings ↑ Arasimowicz-Jeloneketal.(2009b,a)\\nGuzmania monostachia PEG Leaves ↑ MiotoandMercier(2013)\\nHordeum vulgare Withholding water Seedling ↑ Montilla-Bascónetal.(2017)\\nMedicago truncatula Withholding water Roots/leave/seedlings ↑ Filippouetal.(2011)\\nOryza sativa PEG/mannitol Leaves ↑ Cai etal.(2015); Xiongetal.(2012)\\nPisum sativum Dehydrationatdry air Seedlings ↑ Leshem andHaramaty(1996)\\nPisum sativum L.

NO can reduce lipid free radicals (R*), superoxide\\nanions (O 2−), and hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) when they reach toxic\\nlevels (Hu et al., 2016). Furthermore, NO can mitigate the negative\\neffect of ROS, via lipid peroxidation, encouraging photosynthesis and\\nexpression of antioxidant enzymes through MAPK and other signaling\\npathways(Asaietal.,2008;Shi etal.,2014).Forinstance,SOD,CAT,\\nascorbateperoxidase(APX)dehydroascorbatereductase(DHAR)via S-\\nnitrosylation activities may increase to mitigate oxidative damage\\ncaused by ROS (Shi and Chan, 2014). Moreover, role of NO in the al-\\nleviationofROS-mediatedoxidativestressisestablishedbyimproving\\ncell stability and elasticity through reinforcement of cell phospholipid\\nbilayerandenhancingthefluidityofmembrane,balancingcellularROS\\nlevel and regulating the toxicity (Gan et al., 2015). For instance, in\\ncucumberandricetheexogenousapplicationofNOenhanceddrought\\ntolerance with increased antioxidants, that scavenge ROS\\n(Arasimowicz-Jeloneketal.,2009a; Farooqetal.,2009).\\nFurther in this context, the role of peroxisomes is of particular im-\\nportance. Although peroxisomes are simple organelles, their im-\\nportance in terms of cell viability under basal as well as stress condi-\\ntions is undeniable. In addition to their significant role in ROS\\nmetabolism, these organelles are also an endogenous source of nitric\\noxide (NO) and various other reactive nitrogen species (RNS). At the\\ncellular level NO and H 2O2act as retrograde signals among different\\ncompartments, facilitating cellular adaptation to stress conditions.Interestingly, there is a possibility that parts of this network may be-\\ncome overloaded under nitro-oxidative conditions, causing cellular\\ndamageand/orcelldeath(Corpasetal.,2017).Plantperoxisomeshave\\na dynamic metabolism of ROS and RNS. These molecules affect the\\nfunctionality of target proteins, peptides or fatty acidsvia posttransla-tionalmodifications(Corpasetal.,2019).\\n1.2.2.

Fur-\\nthermore, it has been shown that NO plays a role in stomatal closure\\nstimulated by ABA in Arabidopsis (Neill et al., 2008), which was con-\\nfirmed in the Arabidopsis nia1/nia2 knockout mutant with unchanged\\nstomatal action (Chen et al., 2016). NO-induced stomatal closure and\\nreductionintranspirationhasalsobeendemonstratedinwheatandthe\\nfaba bean (García-Mata and Lamattina, 2001; Santisree et al., 2015)\\nalthough a contrasting report, also in faba beans, indicated that NO\\ninducestomatalopeninginsteadofclosing(García-MataandLamattina,\\n2001). Activation of MAPK signaling cascades drive stomatal closure\\nthrough NO has been also reported in plants (Zhang et al., 2007). Al-\\nthoughplantNOsignalingpathwaysduringdroughtstressremaintobe\\nfully elucidated, NO has been observed to upregulate the levels of\\ncGMP, which activates downstream plant defense genes. Similarly,\\ncyclic adenine dinucleotide phosphate ribose (cADPR), another sec-\\nondary messenger of NO signaling, is also known to activate defense\\ngenes (Sekietal.,2001).\\n1.2.3. ImpactofexogenousandendogenousNOon drought-stressedplants\\nMost plant studies on NO have involved exogenous application of\\nNO donors or inhibitors/scavengers. For instance, the most basic NO\\ndonorsused inplant droughtstressexperiments are sodiumnitroprus-\\nside (SNP), S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), S-ni-\\ntrosoglutathione (GSNO), and diethylamine NONOate sodium (DEA-NONOate). These NO donors are either applied through the roots assupplementsingrowthmedia,injectedintotheleafapoplastorsprayed\\nonto the plants. Growth and yield of plants exposed to stress were\\nrescuedbySNPsupplementation(Farooqetal.,2009).Literatureshows\\nthat exogenous NO can reduce the negative effects of water stress\\n(Farooq et al., 2009; Liao et al., 2012; Rahimian Boogar et al., 2014).\\nExogenous SNP application has been reported for drought stress toler-\\nance (Hao et al., 2008) on drought-stressed hull-less barley seedlings\\ntreated with different concentrations of SNP; the results showed that\\ndroughtstressseriouslyalteredphysiologicalfunctionsandgrowthbut\\nNOapplicationalleviatedthedroughtenduringdamagesbyantioxidant\\nand ROS scavenging enzyme activity (Gan et al., 2015). NO also in-\\nteractswithplanthormonesandvariousothersignalingmolecules,and\\nregulates osmoprotectants that protect against drought stress. In con-\\ntrast, NO scavengers such as L-NAME (NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl\\nester)reduceendogenousNOlevels,leadingtohigherstresssensitivity\\n(Hao et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2010a). Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are\\nproducedunderconditionsofdroughtorwaterstress(Campalansetal.,\\n2001; Swindell et al., 2007) and are involved in protein refolding.\\nHSP70, as well as NO, were observed to protect against oxidized cell\\napoptosis(Mosseretal.,1997).LiteraturesuggestsakeyroleofNOin\\nregulating important physiological events of plants (such as photo-\\nsynthesis, defense against oxidative damage, transcription and post-\\ntranslationalmodifications)underheatstressreviewedby(Parankusam\\net al., 2017). Overall, NO is essential during drought conditions and\\nseveral studies have established that NO is produced in various plant\\ntissues.BothendogenousandexogenousapplicationofNOdonorscan\\nhelp protect plants from oxidative injuries, protein denaturation, and\\nthenegativeimpactonphotosynthesis,aswellasenhanceantioxidant\\nmechanismsandmaintaincellwaterlevelillustrated in(Fig.2).\\nBrassinosteroids (BRs) are important for plant growth, develop-\\nment, and stress responses. Brassinolide (BL) pre-treated Medicago\\ntruncatulaplants show enhanced cold stress tolerance potentiated by\\nregulation of cold-related gene expression and antioxidant enzymesactivities. Interestingly, BL-pretreatment induced the production of\\nboth H\\n2O2and NO. Whereas, the application of a brassinazole (BR-in-\\nhibitor)reducedH 2O2andNOproduction(Arfanetal.,2019).Whatis\\nmoreinterestingisthatsuppressionofH 2O2productionbyaninhibitor\\nalso blocks BRs-induced NO production but BR-induced H 2O2produc-\\ntion was not sensitive to NO suppression. Further, the suppression of\\nH2O2and NO production also decreases the expression of BL-induced\\nmitochondrial alternative oxidase (Yanhui et al., 2006) and the pho-tosystem capacity. This indicates that BRs-induced photosystem II ef-\\nficiency is moreNO-dependent thanH\\n2O2(Arfanetal.,2019). Hence,\\ntheproductionandhomeostasissecondarymetabolitessuchasdifferentBRs may be another mechanism through which NO alone or in com-\\nbination with other signaling molecules, exerts its effect in protecting\\nplantsfromabioticstress.\\n1.3. Role of NO in salt stress\\nA global increase in soil salinity threatens plant growth and agri-\\ncultural production (Zhu, 2003). More than 20% of arable land and\\napproximately 50% of irrigated land is affected by salinity stress\\n(Shrivastava and Kumar, 2015). The high saline conditions are dele-\\nterious to plants, inhibiting various biochemical and physiological\\nprocesses(Hasegawaetal.,2000;MunnsandTester,2008).Inaddition,\\nsalt stress normally has a negative effect on ion homeostasis and os-\\nmoticbalanceofplantcells(MunnsandTester,2008).Intracellularion\\nimbalanceinhibitssoilnutrientuptakeleadingtonutritiondeficiencies.\\nFurthermore, salt stress provokes membrane disintegration, loss of\\nmetabolicfunctionionleakage,DNAdefragmentation,andsubsequent\\ncelldeath(Hasegawaetal.,2000).Toamelioratethesenegativeeffects\\nof salt stress, plants have evolved protective mechanisms. These me-\\nchanisms include strategies like modification of the cell membrane,\\nlimiting ion transport to the root, accumulation of specific ions,R.B.S. Nabi, et al.

Moreover, some dehydrogenase\\nenzymes also play a crucial role in NR-dependent NO production; for\\ninstance, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzyme was shown to\\nimprove the tolerance of the red kidney bean root to salt stress (Liu\\net al., 2007). In our laboratory, we recently investigated the involve-\\nment of NO in salt stress mitigation in different rice genotypes. We\\nobserved a significant increase in the expression of OsHIPP38, OsGR1,\\nandOsP5CS2in the salt-susceptible rice genotypes under salt stress\\nwhen the seedlings were treated with NO donor SNP, thus giving a\\nresistant response to salt stress. Whereas, plants that were not treated\\nwith NO donor succumbed to salt-stress. Furthermore, SNP-treated\\nplants produced more biomass under salt stress indicating a positive\\nroleofNOundersaltstress(Adamuetal.,2018).\\nLiteratureshowingtheinvolvementofNOinsaltstressmitigationin\\nplants is listed in Table 2.

Role of NO in heavy-metal stress: aluminum toxicity and cadmium-\\ninduced oxidative stress\\nNatural resources have been contaminated by rapid industrial de-\\nvelopment in the last few decades.

However, how HMs affect the integrity of\\nplants is poorly understood. Plant roots are normally the first tissue\\naffectedbyHM-inducedoxidativestressdamagesincetheyareindirect\\ncontact with the soil. For instance, Alfalfa roots under Cd (Cadmium)\\nand Hg (Mercury) stress showed oxidative and glutathione depletion\\n(Ortega-Villasante et al., 2005). Similarly, a 38% alteration in root\\nlength has recently been observed in Arabidopsis under HM stress\\n(Corpasetal.,2017).ThemorphologicalresponsesinducedbyHMsin\\nvarious plant organs have been reviewed by (Kolbert, 2016). Heavy\\nmetal or metalloid stress can be toxic to plants, inducing notable\\nchangesinplantmorphology,physiology,andcellularandbiochemical\\nfunctions. HMs also negatively impact growth, photosynthesis, re-\\nproduction,antioxidantactivity,asolublecontentofantioxidants,cell\\ndivision,anddifferentiation(SharmaandDietz,2009).Severalstudieshave been conducted to understand how HM stress affects plants and\\nthe mechanisms of recovery from stress (He and Chen, 2014; Kolbert\\netal.,2017;Petoetal.,2013).\\nEndogenousNOaccumulationoccursinresponsetoHMs,although\\nitvarieswithcondition,specificity,andtypeofmetal.Forinstance,in\\nArabidopsis, lead stress resulted in overproduction of NO affectingvarious catalytic reactions in peroxisomes and enhancement of the\\nprimaryandlateralroots(Kolbertetal.,2017).Itisalsointerestingto\\nsee that different studies reporting on heavy metal toxicity and en-\\ndogenous NO production in different plants, have produced contra-\\ndictory results. For instance in soybean, endogenous NO rapidly in-\\ncreases after 72h of heavy metal stress (Kopyra et al., 2006). In\\ncontrast, Rose mallow seedlings under Aluminum stress showed a\\nsudden reduction in endogenous NO level in the roots (Tain et al.,\\n2007). Similarly, there was a significant reduction of endogenous NO\\nlevels in the root of Cd-treated Barrel medic after 48h (Xu et al.,\\n2010a).Thereareseveraladditionalreportsdemonstratingpositiveand\\nnegative changes in NO levels under heavy metal stress; examples in-\\ncludeArabidopsis,soybean,rice,peaandmaizeaswellasseveralother\\nplantspecies(Table4).Theobservedcontradictoryresultsmaybeduetodifferencesinthe typesofHMs,planttissuesexamined,durationof\\nstress, as well as method of NO quantification (Planchet and Kaiser,\\n2006a,2006b).\\nAs a multifunctional gaseous molecule, NO has a vital role in alle-\\nviatingtheHMtoxicityatbothendogenouslevelaswellasexogenous\\napplication.

Monitoring \\nwas done in spring when the annual maximum herbivore impact accumulates on the \\nheather. We  estimated deer presence from pellet -group counts, and for heather we \\nmeasured cover, height and shoot browsing. Deer numbers declined earlier in Glen \\nDerry, and correspondingly heather height increased sooner. Trends in Glen Lui \\nwere related to plot wetne ss and distance from places where the deer were fed in \\nwinter; dry plots received much heavier usage from deer and rabbits initially, \\nkeeping the heather short and cover stable, whereas on wet plots usage was much \\nlower and heather increased both in cover and height. Subsequently, as deer \\ndensities fell, the Lui heather thrived, and by 2013 heather height on dry plots had \\nsurpassed height on wet plots. Colonisation by pine saplings was very patchy, being \\nvirtually confined to plots within 50 m of mature tre es and having heather swards \\nless than 25 cm tall. Despite deer numbers falling, saplings still suffered browsing by \\nblack grouse, lagomorphs and voles. Annual increments were greatest on dry plots \\nin Glen Lui. However, we estimate that another eight years  of negligible deer \\nnumbers are needed for the present sapling crop to become safe from deer damage. \\nA limited regime of burning near mature pines may assist regeneration.  \\n \\nKey Words : heather ; plant communities; red deer; Scots pine ; uplands;  woodland \\nregeneration  \\n \\nIntroduction  \\nWhich landscapes and vegetation types  are wanted in the British uplands is currently \\nreceiving much debate, with widely divergent options  advocated  by different \\norganisations , landowners, and the general public . Some want attractive open \\nlandscapes for recreation, some w ant sporting use including deer stalking and \\ngrouse shooting, some want agricultural production, some want the conservation or \\nrestoration of  habitat types that have become rare in recent times, some wa nt \\nwildness with no noticeable human impacts , and several other demands and outputs \\nare locally important . A new review on upland management in Scotland (Morgan -\\nDavies et al., 2015) employed two dichotomies in consider ing these uses:21 \\n management  either  for “the few” or for “the many” and management either for an \\noutput of  consumables or  for provid ing non-consumable values or “delights”.  The \\nauthors  documented  a recent swing  towards “delights for the many”  that now \\ninfluenc es much upland management, so no longer do a few owners  with large \\nestates  control  the Scottish uplands exclusively for their own purposes.  \\nTo achieve any of these diverse objectives , knowledge is required on the \\nresponse  of the main upland vegetation types  to different management regimes , \\nespecially if they develop into different communities , and on the time scale of such \\nsuccessions.  Much is now known about the Scottish uplands, as shown by the wide \\nvariety of  papers  included in a book edited by  Thompson  et al. (1995) , but th ese \\nstudies  deal largely with cultural moorlands managed by burning. In such moorlands \\nthe natural successions to woodland are prevented in order  that dwarf shrubs \\nparticularly heather ( Calluna vulgaris ) can flourish and provide good food and habitat \\nfor livestock and game birds, these being a gricultural or sporting management s.  \\nFor a recovery of native woodlands in the uplands and/or a return to \\nwilderness or wildness, it is very desirable to know how long it takes for native \\nbroad -leaved trees or Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) to establish themselves \\nsufficiently that regeneration  cannot be halted or reverse d by grazing animals, and \\nwhat herbivore densities allow the se successions to progress. But very few such \\nassessments have been made (Miles  et al., 1978; Marrs & Welch , 1991; Rao, 2017), \\nmainly because such successions  have been confined to a very small proportion of \\nall upland  ground  and their slowness  makes continued observation difficult and \\ncostly to sustain. Also , the time scales  estimated  for woodland establishment have \\nbeen very variable , ranging from around 10 years to more than 50 years (Marrs & \\nWelch , 1991).  \\nThe key species  affecting or c hecking successions in much British moorland is \\nCalluna vulgaris , and so most studies on moorland vegetation dynamics have \\nconcentrated on it (Legg , 1995).  The cover and height of  heather  control the \\ngraminoid and herbaceous species present (Harris  et al., 2011; Welch  & Scott , 1995) \\nand can prevent the initial establishment of tree saplings . In the former study the \\ntime scale of  heather  change was deduced by  examining c. 1000 burnt patches  2-18 \\nyears -old in five Peak District moorlands , cover and height being found to be directly \\nand closely related to the time elapsed since burning, and the cover and number of \\nsubsidiary species was inversely related to heather height.  But herbivore grazing was \\nnot assessed, tree saplings did not colonise, and the authors lame nted that “so little \\nis known about moorland post -fire succession” in Britain.  \\nLong-term monitoring  of heather  performance and tree colonisation on the Mar \\nLodge Estate in the Cairngorms is provid ing further  evidence about moorland \\nsuccessions, and is reported in th e present  paper . Partly the observations have been \\nenabled because the National Trust for Scotland, the owners of the estate since \\n1995, have had a policy of no burning in the study glens  in order to give a greater \\nfeeling of “naturalness” f or the many visitors. The monitoring began in two glens in \\n1991 following much concern about the intense pressure of high numbers of red \\ndeer ( Cervus elaphus  L.) on the estate moorlands and especially the lack of \\nregeneration of the native Caledonian pinewoods . The Mar Lodge Estate then \\ncontributed a major proportion of t he total deer in the Cairngorms and West \\nGrampian Deer Management Group , and counts by the Red Deer Commission had \\nshown a large increase in number over the previous two decades (Callander &22 \\n Mackenzie , 1991).  So there was a conservation -led demand for an assessment of \\nthis deer impact, in the hope that showing “damage” would encour age a reduction in \\nred-deer numbers.  \\nHence  base-line data about the heather state under intense grazin g was \\nobtained  in 1991 -1995 before the new ownership increased the deer cull  on most of \\nthe Mar Lodge Estate, and heather recovery  started  in Glen Derry  and Glen Lui. A \\nfirst paper (Welch et al., 2006) described the heather  trends up to spring 2001 that \\nhad resulted from the initial reduc tion in  deer grazing, and some separate \\nmonitoring of colonising pine saplings was described by Rao (2011 ; 2017 ). The \\npresent paper reports the heather  trends and tree colonisation up to 2015 in the two \\nglens on 186 plots monitored since 1991.  \\n \\nStudy areas \\nThe two study areas lay along rivers in topographic basins with high mountains \\naround .

Both areas had  extensive  flat terraces  by the \\ncentral rivers , but only in Glen Derry  were these heather -dominated . The Lui \\nterraces were  mostly  grasslands lacking heather  and had been cultivated in the \\neighteenth century ; afterwards they were fertilised to maintain rich grazing for \\nlivestock.  The study  areas were largely treeless but some remnant ind ividual old \\ntrees of Scots pine grew in the southern half of the Glen Derry area; in the Glen Lui \\narea remnant old pines were even fewer and confined to the South corner . However ,23 \\n several small exclosures within and near the Lui  area had been planted with conifers \\nin the early 1970s (Scott , 1998). \\n \\n \\nFigure 1 . Position and shape of the two study areas (hatched: upper, Glen Derry; \\nlower, Glen Lui) in valleys of the Eastern Cairngorms. Arrows show direction of \\nriver flow. Surrounding peaks have altitudes given in metres. Map size is 13 x 11 \\nkm; the bottom SW corner is at NO 000890 on the British National Grid.  \\n \\nThe Glen Derry monitoring area was the higher in altitude, being both \\nupstream from Glen Lui and having steeper va lley sides. It had a greater extent of \\nwet soils, mainly peaty gleys, and drier podsols were largely confined to its steep \\neastern flank.  The peaty gleys mostly bore Erica tetralix  wet heath ( National \\nVegetation Classification ( NVC) M16; Rodwell , 1991), with local Scirpus cespitos us – \\nErica tetralix NVC M15 wet heath, and on patches of deeper peat there was Erica \\ntetralix – Sphagnum papillosum  mire NVC M18. The podsols supported Calluna \\nvulgaris – Vaccinium myrtillus  NVC H12 heath, and parts of the central alluvial \\nterraces had Nardus stricta – Galium saxatile  NVC U5 grassland. Nardus  stricta  also24 \\n was locally dominant in the far north -east corner of the Derry area  in flushed ground \\nabove the 600  m contour.  \\nThe Glen Lu i monitoring area had extensive podsols on its sloping flanks \\nbearing Calluna vulgaris – Vaccinium myrtillus  NVC H12 heath. South -west of the \\nriver there was a tract of wetter ground with peaty podsols and gleys, the vegetation \\nbeing predominately Erica te tralix wet heath NVC M16. The central alluvial \\ngrasslands lacking Calluna were not monitored  in this area .  \\nDeer were regularly fed on the  Lui riverside  grasslands in winter  until 2001 , \\nand our  counts confirmed that almost all the deer  using the Lui area  were stags , in \\nline with  the male-female  dichotomy that had long existed in this part of the Eastern \\nCairngorms . The Glen Derry area was in hind ground, and stags moved into it mostly \\nin the autumn rut.  \\nIn 1992  heather  cover was greater in Glen Lui, with mean occurrence 73% in \\nthe 8-cm diameter sampling circles as opposed to  67% in Glen Derry (Table 1) (see \\nMethods). But the  heather  was somewhat taller in Glen Derry, averaging 25 cm \\nheight as opposed to  17 cm in  Glen Lui . In Glen Derry 18% of the mo nitoring plots \\nhad heather i nitial height s greater than 30 cm  and a few plots ha d initial mean \\nheight s of 50 cm. In Glen Lui  almost half the plots had suppressed heather with \\nmean heights less than 20 cm in 1992, and 40 cm was the maximum initial height \\nthere.  \\nBurning of  heather  had formerly been the normal management practice on Mar \\nLodge Estate, but aerial photographs taken i n 1946, 1961 and 1966 indicated  its \\nfrequency was declin ing and 1989 photographs showed very little ground had been \\nburnt in the previous decade. This probably reflected m uch heather being in a \\nsuppressed state due to the rising deer population . After 1990 only a tiny section of \\nmoorland was burnt in the monitoring areas  due to an accidental fire . \\n   \\nMethods  \\nPermanent monitoring plots were set up in winter 1991 -1992 and then visited each \\nspring. The  plots were equally spaced on grids covering the whole of both \\nmonitoring areas except the riverside grasslands  in Glen Lui  (Fig. 1) . Plot size was 15 \\nx 4 m; there were 96 plots in Glen Derry and 90 in Glen Lui .  \\nThe regular monitoring was of 1) deer and lagomor ph usage and 2) heather  \\ncover, heather height and heather shoot damage from b rowsing. A dditionally , the \\nplots were assessed in the first two springs  for soil wetness (wet, moist or dry), and \\nin 1998 and 2001 the annual growth increment of  heather  was measured on 15 \\nshoots per plot. Deer usage was estimated by counting the  total number of pellet \\ngroups on the plots, and hare and rabbit usage was recorded on a 3 -point index \\nscale, dividing at mean densities of 8 and 25 pellets m-2. Assessments on heather \\ncover and shoot browsing were made using a sampling stick that had  four 8 -cm \\ndiameter circles . It was  placed at ten positions in each plot, these arranged in two \\nparallel rows along the plots lying alternately at 45°  to the  left and right of the plot \\naxis, hence 40 circles were examined per plot . All the circles were checked for the \\npresence of any green shoot of  heather  to give a  cover index, and in the first four \\ncircles with heather  present  we counted browsed and unbrowse d long shoots to give \\na measure of shoot utilisation . Mean height was estimated from c. 25 ruler measures \\nspread evenly in all the  heather  patches on a plot .25 \\n Observations on saplings of Scots pine began in 1997. When the study was \\nplanned it was not envisaged that deer numbers would be reduced sufficiently to \\nallow tree regeneration, but by 1996 this had become a management objective and \\na few sapling pines wer e seen on our plots in Glen Derry , deer numbers having \\nfallen  there. From 1998 onwards the heights of saplings were measured in Glen \\nDerry and their positions  on plots were mapped . In 2000 , systematic observations \\nwere extended to the Glen Lui plots, and any visible saplings were recorded \\nwhatever the tree species . Our counts were not an absolute count of seedlings and \\nsaplings since these are too small to be noticed within the taller heather  of most \\nplots until they are at least three or four years old ; many very young seedlings die \\ndue to competition and shading, and once bigger they suffer browsing from black \\ngrouse, lagomorphs and voles as well as  deer. Therefore the counts merely provide  \\nan index of potential tree colonisation. In later years large numbers of pine saplings \\nappeared on a h andful of plots, and then we measured only the taller ones for \\nheight.  Many plots with saplings lay close to mature Scots pines, and Chi -square \\ntests were used to assess the significance of the association.  \\nAfter 1996 yearly observations on heather cover were considered unnecessary, \\nmean values having  been found to change  little from year to year . A further cut -back \\nto reduce the time required to do the monitoring started  in 1999 , only half the plots \\nin each glen being  visited that year and in some later ones . These plots were spread  \\nacross the monitoring areas and chosen to ensure  that the mean values recorded in \\nthe reduced sampling w ere virtually identical to the means obtained on all plots. For \\nthe figures and tables reported here, heather cover and utilisation means are given \\nonly for the years when all plots were visited, but for herbivore usage means are \\ngiven for every year , the variability resulting from the reduced samplin g being \\nconsidered negligible.  \\nTo assess the impact of herbivores on heather , the study years were divided \\ninto four successive periods with progressively declining usage; end dates were \\nchosen for these periods when full sampling was available. The significances of \\nchanges in heather cover and height were assessed for each period using paired t -\\ntests that compar ed the plot data obtained in the first and last years of these \\nperiods.  For Glen Lui, the impact of the deer being fed on the central grasslands \\nuntil 2001 was assessed by assigning plots to four zones defined by distance fr om \\nthe grasslands and comparing zonal usage and heather data between  the periods \\nbefore and after 2001.  For the dung index and heather utilisation, zone year means \\nin the two periods were compared using paired t -tests; for cover and height change, \\nplot measurements obtained in the first and last years of each period were \\ncompared by paired t -tests in each zone.  \\nNomenclature follows Stace (2010) for vascular plants, Rodwell (1991) for plant \\ncommunities, and Smith (2006) for mosses.  \\n \\nResults  \\nUsage by deer  and lagomorphs  \\nUsage by deer measured from the spring counts of pellet groups fell greatly during \\nthe 24-year study period  (Fig. 2) . Number s of pellet groups  began to fall in 1995, \\nand for the next seven years usage was much less in Glen Derry  than Glen Lui. A \\nvery sharp decline between 2001 and 2002 in Glen Lui reflected not only increased \\nculling but also the cessation of winter feeding on the central grasslands; hay,26 \\n carrots or potatoes spread every day or two days in winter s till 2000 had attracted \\nmany stags which, after their feeding bout, moved onto the surrounding heather \\nmoorland.  Both red -deer and roe -deer pellet  group s contributed to the count totals, \\nbut numbers of the latter were negligible. After 2008 an intensification in the culling \\nof stags brought usage down to similar very low levels in both glens.  \\n  \\n              \\n             \\nFigure 2 . Usage by deer (upper) and lagomorphs measured in springs of 24 years \\n(1992 -2015) in the two glens.

Initially , mean utilisation was about a third less in Glen Derry than \\nGlen Lui . This  difference increased up to 2000, reflecting the divergence observed in \\ndeer numbers. In Glen L ui wet plots had much  lower  utilisation  than d rier ones, \\npartly due to deer usage but also to  rabbit  grazing; rabbits were confined to the \\ndrier parts of this glen . In Glen Derry  three of the monitoring plots were classed as \\ndry but had utilisation and deer usage no different to the moist plots, hence the se \\ntypes have been pooled  and are named moist in this paper .  \\n \\n            \\n            \\nFigure 3 .

But \\nmean heather cover was lower on the wet plots in both glens, and heather changed \\nmuch less in mean cover in Glen Derry (Fig. 4). This is reflected by the difference \\nbetween glens in the number of significant cover increases fo und for the successive \\nobservation periods defined on declining deer usage (Table 2). In Glen Derry the \\noverall 22 -year increase in the percentage of sampling circles having heather present \\nwas just 3%; this was calculated from means of 26.9 and 28.1 circl es containing \\nheather out of 40 in 1992 and 2014 respectively. The only significant change for \\nGlen Derry was for all 96 plots in the 1997 -2001 period ( P < 0.01).  \\n \\n           \\n           \\nFigure 4 .

By the last years of \\nthe study many plots in Glen Lui had heather present in all 40 sampling circles, \\nlimiting the possible  increase measurable by our index.    \\n \\nTable 2.

Height increased significantly from 1992 to 2001 only in the peripheral zone to \\nthe central grasslands (> 300 m distant), and this zone  then had significantly less \\ndeer usage ( P < 0.001 ) and heather percentage shoot browsing ( P < 0.001 ) than \\nthe other three zones  (paired t -tests) . For the 2001 to 2013 period with no feeding \\nand lower overall deer usage, heather height increased sharply in all four zones but \\nless in the peripheral zone.

Just \\neleven  small saplings of three other tree species , Larix decidua , Sorbus  aucuparia,32 \\n and Salix cinerea, were found on the plots , some of them surviving  for just  one or  \\ntwo years . However tiny bushes of Juniperus communis occurred on several plots in \\nGlen Derry and although not measured , they seemed to make no gain in height and \\nwere suffering repeated browsing.  \\nPine saplings appeared sooner in Glen Derry than Glen Lui  (Fig. 6). Up to 1998 \\nthere was mostly only a single sapling on a plot and many were not found the \\nfollowing spring , hence the initial variability in the percentage of plots with saplings. \\nAfter 2001, sapling numbers increased and 7 of the 96 Derry plots had saplings \\npresent throughout the rest of the study, though few further plots were colonised. \\nBy 2015 there were 95 saplings on 11 plots. Most of the 18 plots that at some time \\nhad saplings were at the south end of the Glen Derry area close to tall old pi nes: 11 \\nof the 18 lay within 50 m of old pines and almost all the post -2001 increase in \\nsapling number was on them. The association of sapling presence on plots and old \\npines being < 50 m distant was highly significant (Chi -sq = 16.8, P < 0.001), and \\nplots situated > 50 m from old pines contributed very little to the sapling total \\nhaving at most 2 saplings present in any recording.   \\nIn Glen Lui pine saplings were observed only twice on monitoring plots before \\n2008 (Fig. 6). Then steady colonisation began o n two plots and by 2014 these plots \\ncontributed 206 out of the 238 total saplings. The two plots lay within 20 m of \\nexclosures planted with pines and other conifers in 1971, and another four plots on \\nwhich saplings appeared in 2009 -2011 were less than 50 m  distant to mature pines \\nproducing cones; the association of sapling presence on plots with mature pines \\nbeing < 50 m distant was highly significant (Chi -sq = 11.2 P < 0.001), as in Glen \\nDerry. However, 11 of the 19 plots situated inside this 50 m radius z one were never \\nfound to have saplings.  \\nThe heights of the saplings increased only very slowly in Glen Derry, due to \\nregular browsing. By 2009, the average of top heights on all plots with saplings had \\nonly reached 14.1 cm, a rise of 0.5 cm since 1998 (Fig . 7). The year means came \\nfrom 11 plots, but due to sapling deaths and new occurrences only 6 plots were \\ncommon to 1998 and 2009. From 2009 to 2015 the same 11 plots kept saplings and \\nmean top plot heights rose by 8.5 cm. The turnover of saplings meant ver y few \\nindividuals were recorded for more than ten years, but the 6 saplings on 4 separate \\nplots present for 11 years from 2003 had mean heights of 14.7 cm (2003), 14.8 cm \\n(2006), 16.0 cm (2009), 18.2 cm (2012) and 20.0 cm (2014). Setbacks to height \\nincreme nt due to browsing were fewer in later years. However, the top tree of all \\nGlen Derry plots early in the study, that had reached 52 cm height by 2006, was \\nthen thrashed by roe deer, and was dead in 2008, causing the sharp drop that year \\nin top heights (Fig . 7). \\nIn Glen Lui the top saplings gained height steadily (Fig. 7). All but one of those \\nappearing in 2008 -2010 were on plots classed as dry, and their annual increments \\nwere greater than those of the Glen Derry saplings. Because many new saplings \\nappeared  each year once colonisation began in this glen, mean plot heights showed \\nlittle increase, and so give a poorer measure than the top heights of the time needed \\nto produce definite tree colonisation not liable to be stopped by deer. The tallest Lui \\nsapling,  57 cm tall in 2015, is not likely to have reached for at least six more years \\nsufficient height to be safe from thrashing or from browsing when snow is deep.33 \\n              \\n             \\nFigure 6 .

The heather bushes on these \\nwet plots did gain height (Fig. 5) but many are old and moribund, and had few \\nlateral shoots, so there seems little prospect of succession in this community.  \\n  \\n           \\n           \\nFigure 7 .

Broom is \\nlimited to low altitudes in Britain , rarely occurring above 600 m  (Preston, Pearman & \\nDines , 2002) , and dieback results from low winter tempera tures (Peterson & Prasad , \\n1998). So succession to broom dominance in Glen Lui therefore seems unlikely.   \\nThe heather  itself is susceptible to winter die -back; this follow s desiccation due \\nto continued transpiration  when the ground is deeply frozen (Watson et al., 1966). \\nDie-back has been shown to vary considerably between years on neighbouring \\nmoorland (Moss & Miller , 1976), and a major die -back event was observed at \\nAbernethy 20 km north of Glen Derry  in spring 2003  (Hancock , 2008).  Limited \\nheather browning and die -back was seen in most springs in our Mar Lodge \\nmonitoring, but we did not measure it  and in 2003 only obtained estimates of \\nheather cover in Glen Lui.  However , in spring 2004 heather was noted as being in \\n“poor condition”  on some plots, and between 2003 and 2005 there was a decline in \\nthe cover index on wet plots (Fig. 4). At Abernethy die -back was more severe on \\nflatter ground and where heather had less cover (Hancock , 2008), conditions that \\napply to our wet plots . So die -back as well as selective grazing, poor growth and old \\nage may contribute to the observed lower overall cover gains on our wet plots ; there \\nwas actually cover loss on the Lui  wet plots from 2001 to 2007 (Table 2) unexpected \\nin view of the low deer usage, and still in 2013 the cover index was lower than in \\n1998 to 2003 for them (Fig. 4).  \\nColonisation by sapling Scots pines has started in both Glen Derry and Glen Lui \\nbut is currently limited to a very few plots and a considerable further period of \\nnegligible  browsing from deer will be  necessary for it to succeed.  Almost all the \\nsaplings observed occur within 50 m of coning  pines but plots inside this limit \\ncomprise less than a fifth of the overall number monitored (Table 1). One of the two \\nGlen Lui plots with many saplings l ies just 15 m from a plantation of 1971 , fitting \\nwith observations in the nearby Ballochbuie pinewood that saplings were most \\nnumerous within 20 m of seed so urces (Scott et al., 2000). Also important in \\nsignificantly explaining sapling number at Ballochbuie was low heather height, and \\nsimilarly  in the  Northern  Cairngorms French et al. (1997) found pine establishment \\non moorland to be greatest when sward  height was less than 20 cm. In the present \\nstudy  there was a similar finding for Glen Lui: the two plots with many saplings had \\nmean heather height of just 10 cm in 2010, and three more of the seven plots  then \\nwith such low height experienced  colonisation.  In Glen Derry plots within 50 m of \\nseed sources had taller heather (mean height 30 cm in 2008 ), which may well have \\ncontribute d to the sapling numbers being lower there than in Glen Lui.  \\nThe trends  in plot sapling top  heights (Fig. 7) give a rough indication of how \\nlong it will take for the pine saplings to reach a height  safe from deer damage ; we \\njudge  this height  to be about 180 cm , allowing for deep snow and trunks being \\nstrong and thick enough to deter , or survive  from, thrashing or bark stripping by \\ndeer. In Glen Lui , plot top heights rose by 1 4 cm in the two years from 2013, and \\nfrom our continuing measurements on the Ballochbuie saplings, annual increments \\ncould rise to average 20 cm once the Glen Lui saplings re ach 1 m height. This means \\nit will take , on average,  another eight years for the 14 plots currently with sapling s36 \\n to have at least one tree reaching safety, and rather less time on the plots with best \\ngrowth.  In Glen Derry , top heights have gained by only about 1 cm a year since \\n2010, reflecting the much poorer growing conditions on wet soils at higher altitudes, \\nand doubtless  it will take decades there for regeneration to occur away from \\nfavourable drier situations.  Small mean annual increments  of saplings have also \\nbeen found by Rao (2017)  on plots next to  mature pines stands  on Mar Lodge ; \\nincrements  varied between her study areas but have much increased since 2008. \\nSo a conjunction of at least four circumstances and factors is needed for \\nsuccessful pine colonisation at mid altitudes in the Cairngorms: (1) very low grazing \\npressure, (2) adult coning trees within 50 m, (3) heather sward s of less height than \\n20 cm, and (4) soils not wet. Although a quarter of the Glen Derry plots and nearly \\nhalf the Glen Lui plots had heather height less than 20 cm when the study began \\n(Table 1), by the time that red -deer numbers had fallen suitably low ( c. 2002 in Glen \\nDerry and c. 2009 in Glen Lui), these plots comprised just 3% and 19% of the total \\npresent in the respective study areas. And in Glen Lui only 9 of these 17 plots with \\nlow heather lay within 50 m of pine seed sources.    \\nThe National Trust for Scotland in their management p lanning (2012) recognise \\nthe need for more ground to be made suitable for pine establishment  in both Glen \\nDerry and Glen Lui, and have considered scarification and heather burning as ways \\nof achieving this.  Both will reduce the perception of naturalness for visitors, but \\nheather burning is a very controversial issue at present (Davies  et al., 2016), and is \\nlikely to be held back until experiments with scarification have started; the 2012 plan \\nsays “burning will be explored during the first few years” of i ntervention work.  We \\nconsider that small -scale burning around old ancient pines limited to 20 -30 m radius \\nfrom the trees would  be acceptable and successful , and suggest that a suitable area \\nfor this to be tested is at the south extremity of the Glen Lui ar ea where the soils are \\ndry. \\nOnce patches of regenerated pine trees have been achieved they are likely to  \\ngive places where red deer can feed, rest and shelter, and control of deer there will \\nbe more difficult than in the present open moorland and remnant stands of old \\npinewood. This should not be considered bad since the deer will regularly emerge \\nand feed i n the surrounding heather -dominated moorland.  Hence  these areas will \\nstay open, still giving visitors attractive views of the surrounding landscape with high \\nmountains.  This will ensure that delights for the many (Morgan -Davies  et al., 2015) \\nwill have been combined with satisfaction to conservationists due to  the Scots pine \\nwoodland  that they greatly value having  a safe future on the Mar Lodge  Estate . \\nA drawback of the very light grazing needed to achieve regeneration of the \\nScots pinewo ods is that this has allowed the heather to grow much taller especially \\non drier soils, and the risk of serious fires has increased.  Tall heather now extends \\nacross a m uch larger block of ground than our two study areas, and it would be \\ndifficult and costly to reduce fire risk by creating firebreaks within this ground.  \\nThis study has ended in its present form, but several elements could usefully \\nbe continued to better give answers about the time scale for vegetation change and \\npinewood colonisation in Cairngorm glens and moorland. The NVC M15 Scirpus \\ncespitosus – Erica tetralix  wet heath might  develop into a Calluna -dominated \\ncommunity akin to H12 with scarce E. tetralix  if the heather were to increase in \\ncover following its recent height increase; this  possibility is suggested by stands of \\nthese two types alternating on the west side of Glen Derry . They occur on what37 \\n seem similar soils, and possibly the M15 areas are the result of fires decades ago \\nfrom which Calluna has recovered much more slowly than Erica tetralix . The possible \\ncolonisation of Cytisus scoparius  on the dry south -facing slopes of Glen Lui should \\nalso be monitored with specific measurements on its cover.  These warmer slopes on \\nrelatively rich soils should also be watched for the possibl e colonisation of deciduous \\ntrees, rowan ( Sorbus aucuparia ) being the most likely. But most important is further \\nmonitoring is to gain more knowledge on the time scale for Scots pine saplings to \\nreach a safe height from deer damage, and about the plot cond itions that allow pine \\nseedlings to colonise within the 50 m range of pine seed sources. For this , our \\nexisting plots could be utilised and extra ones set up.  \\n \\nAcknowledgements  \\nToo many people have helped in a study lasting 25 years to be named individually , \\nbut we are grateful to them all.

When wheat plants were spray-treated with three safener chemistries, namely\\ncloquintocet mexyl,  mefenpyr  diethyl  and  fenchlorazole  ethyl,  an  apparently  identical  subset  of  GSTs\\nderived from the tau, phi and lambda classes accumulated in the foliage. Treatment with the closely\\nrelated mefenpyr  diethyl  and  fenchlorazole  ethyl  enhanced  seedling  shoot  growth,  but  this  effect  was\\nnot determined  with  the  chemically  unrelated  cloquintocet  mexyl.  Focussing  on  cloquintocet  mexyl,\\ntreatments were  found  to  only  give  a  transient  induction  of  GSTs,  with  the  period  of  elevation  being  dose\\ndependent.

Studies  on  the  tissue  induction  of  GSTs  showed  that  whilst  phi  and  tau  class  enzymes\\nwere induced  in  all  tissues,  the  induction  of  the  lambda  enzymes  was  restricted  to  the  meristems.

Introduction\\nSafeners are  an  important  group  of  agrochemicals  used  exten-\\nsively in  cereals  to  protect  crops  from  damage  caused  by  selective\\nherbicides without compromising weed control efﬁcacy (Davies\\nand Caseley,  1999;  Edwards  et  al.,  2005;  Hatzios,  2003;  Hatzios\\nand Burgos,  2004).The  mechanism  of  safener  action  most  widely\\naccepted is  that  these  chemicals  enhance  crop  tolerance  by\\ninducing the expression of proteins involved in the metabolism\\nof herbicides,  thus  accelerating  their  detoxiﬁcation  (Davies  and\\nCaseley, 1999;  Hatzios  and  Burgos,  2004).  Amongst  these  ‘safened’\\nenzymes, the best studied are the glutathione transferases (GSTs)\\nwhich catalyze  the  conjugation  of  herbicides  with  the  endoge-\\nnous tripeptide  glutathione  (Cummins  et  al.,  1997;  Davies  and\\nCaseley, 1999;  DeRidder  and  Goldsbrough,  2006).  Such  conjuga-\\ntion has been demonstrated in barley (Scalla and Roulet, 2002),\\nmaize (Fuerst  et  al.,  1993;  Scarponi  et  al.,  2006),  wheat  (Cummins\\n∗Corresponding author  at:  The  Food  and  Environment  Research  Agency,  Sand\\nHutton,\\n York  YO41  1LZ,  UK.

In  addition,  it  is  known  that  safeners  enhance  the  expression\\nof other  classes  of  detoxifying  enzymes  including  the  cytochrome\\nP450 mixed function oxygenases (Persans et al., 2001), type 1 glu-\\ncosyltransferases (UGTs)  (Brazier  et  al.,  2002)  and  ATP-binding\\ncassette (ABC)  transporter  proteins  in  a  range  of  plants  (Coleman\\net al.,  1997;  Riechers  et  al.,  2010).\\nOne intriguing characteristic of safeners is their apparent\\nspecies speciﬁcity,  with  different  classes  of  chemistry  being  devel-\\noped for  use  in  each  of  the  major  cereal  crops  (Riechers  et  al.,  2010).\\nIn addition, for each given species a number of different safener\\nchemistries have  been  developed.  For  example  in  wheat  (Triticum\\naestivum L.),  the  quinolinoxycarboxylic  acid  cloquintocet  mexyl,  as\\nwell as  the  unrelated  compounds  mefenpyr  diethyl  and  fenchlo-\\nrazole ethyl have been widely used as post-emergence safeners\\n(Fig. 1).  All  these  compounds  are  used  to  safen  aryloxyphenoxypro-\\npionate (AOPP)  herbicides  which  inhibit  the  essential  enzyme\\nacetyl CoA  carboxylase.  All  chemical  classes  of  safener  are  known\\nto functionally  exert  their  protective  effect  by  enhancing  herbi-\\ncide detoxiﬁcation  in  wheat.  For  example,  cloquintocet  mexyl  is\\nknown to  increase  the  rate  of  hydroxylation,  ether  cleavage,  and\\n0098-8472 ©  2012 Elsevier B.V. \\ndoi:10.1016/j.envexpbot.2011.12.030Open access under CC BY license.\\nOpen access under C C BY license.94 V.L.

In each case, whilst\\nthe safeners have been individually shown to enhance the activities\\nor expression  of  several  classes  of  herbicide-metabolising  enzymes,\\nthere have been no reported attempts to compare the relative efﬁ-\\ncacy of these chemicals in inducing detoxiﬁcation responses either\\nqualitatively or quantitatively. It is also clear that whilst wheat\\nsafeners are  predominantly  used  commercially  to  enhance  toler-\\nance towards a speciﬁc partner herbicide, this protective ability\\nextends to multiple classes of chemistry. For example, in addition to\\nsafening the AOPP herbicide fenoxaprop ethyl in wheat, mefenpyr\\ndiethyl also  increases  the  selectivity  ratio  of  the  unrelated  sulfonyl\\nureas mesosulfuron-methyl and iodosulfuron methyl-sodium by\\nenhancing their  detoxiﬁcation  (Hacker  et  al.,  2000).\\nUsing cloquintocet mexyl, mefenpyr diethyl and fenchlorazole\\nethyl as  different  classes  of  safener  (Fig.  1),  we  now  address  whether\\nor not  distinct  chemistries  invoke  different  responses  in  detoxify-\\ning enzymes  in  wheat.  We  then  use  different  treatment  regimes  to\\ntest the longevity and dose dependence of response and evaluate\\nthe ability  of  safeners  to  protect  wheat  from  soil  borne  chemical\\npollutants in  addition  to  herbicides.\\n2.\\n Materials  and  methods\\n2.1.

As  with  the  GST\\nactivity towards  CDNB,  the  GPOX  activity  then  declined  over  3  days.\\nFrom these  total  GST  activity  studies  it  appeared  that  the  three\\nsafeners promoted very similar responses over the 3-day sampling\\nperiod. To  test  the  equivalence  of  these  responses  in  greater  detail,\\nthe plants  were  assayed  for  GST  polypeptides  which  were  recog-\\nnised by  antisera  raised  to  maize  phi  GSTFl-ll  and  the  wheat  lambda\\nGSTL and  tau  GSTUl-l  (Cummins  et  al.,  2009).  These  antisera  were\\nselected as  all  three  classes  were  known  to  be  induced  by  safeners\\nin wheat  (Cummins  et  al.,  1997;  Edwards  et  al.,  2005;  Theodoulou\\net al., 2003). Following SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, all three\\nantisera recognised  polypeptides  of  around  25  kDa  (Fig.  3),  which\\nis the  typical  relative  molecular  mass  of  a  GST  subunit.  The  tau\\n(GSTU) antiserum  recognised  polypeptides  in  the  control  samples\\nwhich were enhanced to similar degrees by all three safeners. The\\nphi anti-GSTF-serum  also  recognised  a  major  polypeptide  in  con-\\ntrol samples  whose  expression  was  enhanced  following  safener\\ntreatment. In addition, this antibody also recognised an inducible\\npolypeptide in the safened plants which migrated with a relative\\nmolecular mass of around 27 kDa. The lambda (GSTL) antiserum\\nidentiﬁed immunoreactive polypeptides in the safened samples\\nwhich were  not  detected  in  the  controls,  reﬂecting  the  strong  link\\nbetween the expression of this class of GST and chemical treatment\\n(Theodoulou et  al.,  2003).

The  results  demonstrated  that\\ncloquintocet mexyl was rapidly hydrolysed to cloquintocet acid,\\nwhich then  accumulated  during  the  induction  period  (data  not\\nshown). To  determine  if  cloquintocet  acid  was  active  as  a  safener,\\nthe parent  ester  was  hydolysed  to  yield  the  free  acid  which  was\\nthen used  to  treat  the  wheat  shoots,  with  the  induction  of  GSTs\\nand GPOX  again  monitored  over  a  48  h  period  (Fig.  5).  The  results\\nobtained showed  that  the  free  acid  gave  essentially  an  identical\\nfold-induction overall  of  both  activities  to  the  parent  ester.  How-\\never, unlike  cloquintocet  mexyl,  the  cloquintocet  acid  only  gave\\nmaximal enhancement  after  24  h  of  treatment.  These  results  sug-\\ngested that  cloquintocet  acid  is  in  fact  the  active  safener,  with  the\\nester effectively  acting  as  an  uncharged  and  hydrophobic  precur-\\nsor which  assists  in  the  rapid  delivery  of  the  compound  across  the\\nwaxy cuticle  of  the  wheat  leaf.  As  such  the  effective  bioactivation\\nof the  safener  is  analogous  to  the  uptake,  hydrolysis  and  activation\\nof herbicide  esters  (Cummins  and  Edwards,  2004).\\nA series  of  simple  experiments  were  then  performed  to  deter-\\nmine the  dose  responsiveness  of  safening  using  a  single  applicationof\\n cloquintocet  mexyl  to  7-day-old  seedlings.  Normal  ﬁeld  rate\\napplications gave  a  58%  increase  in  GST  activity  24  h  after  treat-\\nment, with  a  very  similar  response  seen  with  the  50%  ﬁeld  rate\\ntreatment. Increasing  the  safener  dosage  above  ﬁeld  rate  gave  a\\nsmaller induction  of  GST  activity.  In  each  case,  maximal  induction\\nwas seen  at  24  h,  declining  thereafter  most  noticeably  at  the  lower\\napplication rates.\\nIt was  then  of  interest  to  study  the  GST  induction  response  in\\ndifferent plant  parts.  Wheat  seedlings  were  divided  into  leaves\\nand meristematic  tissues,  with  the  leaves  sub-divided  into  tips\\nand middle  sections.  After  normalising  protein  content,  the  sam-\\nples were  then  analysed  for  CDNB-conjugating  activity  and  phi,\\ntau and  lambda  GST  polypeptide  content  (Table  3).  These  results\\ndemonstrated that  GST  activity  in  the  control  plants  was  four-\\nfold higher  in  the  meristems  than  in  the  foliage,  there  being  no\\ndifferences between  the  tips  and  mid  sections  of  the  leaves.  In\\nterms of enzyme induction, the leaves were more responsive to\\nsafener than  the  meristems.  Based  on  the  Western  blotting  studies,\\nwhilst the  GSTUs  were  present  constitutively  in  both  tissue  types,\\nthe GSTFs  were  largely  restricted  to  the  meristems  in  the  control\\nplants. On safener treatment GSTFs began to accumulate in the\\nleaves, whereas  the  GSTLs  were  only  determined  in  the  meristems\\n(Table 3).\\n3.3.\\n Protective  effect  of  safeners  in  wheat  towards  soil-born\\npollutants\\nWhilst the protective properties of safeners towards herbi-\\ncides are  well  described  in  cereals  (Davies  and  Caseley,  1999),  the\\npotential for  these  compounds  to  enhance  tolerance  towards  less\\nselective phytotoxic chemicals has not been reported. In particular,\\nthe use  of  safeners  to  enhance  chemical  tolerance  in  plants  grown\\nin contaminated  environments  could  be  a  very  useful  new  tool  in\\nphytoremediation. To  examine  the  potential  utility  of  safeners  in\\nremediation applications,  soil  samples  from  a  ‘real’  contaminated\\nsite located  at  a  major  oil  reﬁnery  were  used.  In  addition  to  oil\\nresidues, this  soil  also  contained  elevated  levels  of  heavy  metals\\n(Table 1)  and  was  taken  from  a  site  which  had  proven  difﬁcult  to\\nestablish plants  on  in  the  ﬁeld.  In  view  of  the  differing  activities\\non plant  growth  observed  with  traditional  wheat  safeners  (Fig.  1,\\nTable  3\\nInduction\\n of  GSTs  in  different  wheat  plant  parts  based  on  (A)  enzyme  activity  determination  and  (B)  polypeptide  composition,  results  and  means  ±  standard  deviations  (n  =  6)\\nwith\\n *  results  being  signiﬁcantly  different  from  the  respective  controls  at  a  95%  conﬁdence  interval.\\nA  GST  activity  towards  CDNB  (nkat  mg−1)\\nControl  Cloquintocet  mexyl\\nTip  0.46  (  ±  0.01)  0.99  (  ±  0.02)*\\nMiddle\\n 0.55  (  ±  0.02)  1.01  (  ±  0.01)*\\nMeristem\\n 1.98  (  ±  0.01)  3.05  (  ±  0.02)*\\nB98 V.L.

These maize\\nand rice  safeners  compounds  had  also  been  shown  to  elevate  GST\\ncontent in  wheat  (Edwards  et  al.,  2005),  making  them  suitable\\nfor comparative treatments with cloquintocet mexyl. Wheat seeds\\nwere soaked for 24 h in the four different safeners and then sown\\non the surface of the contaminated soil, along with non-polluted\\ncontrols and  germination  and  growth  determined  over  a  14-day\\nperiod (Table 4). In the absence of safener pre-treatment, none of\\nthe seeds germinated on the contaminated soil, whereas cloquin-\\ntocet mexyl, benoxacor and dichlormid all gave similar results to\\nthose seen  in  the  control  soils.  However,  following  germination\\nthe resulting shoot growth of the safened seedlings was greatly\\nreduced compared  with  controls  and  by  the  end  of  the  14-day\\nperiod the  plants  were  showing  signs  of  chlorosis.  By  28  days  all\\nthe seedlings  exposed  to  the  polluted  soil  were  dead  irrespective  of\\ntreatment.\\n4. Discussion\\nOur results  offer  several  new  insights  into  the  action  of  safeners\\nin wheat. Using the induction of GSTs as a biomarker of detoxiﬁca-\\ntion we have demonstrated that distinct safener chemistries classes\\nessentially induce  identical  responses  in  wheat  seedlings,  and  that\\nthis effect  is  dose-dependent  with  respect  to  saturability  and  tran-\\nsience. Intriguingly,  the  two  chemically  related  safeners,  mefenpyr\\ndiethyl and  fenchlorazole  ethyl  also  provoked  a  growth  enhancing\\neffect. At  the  level  of  tissue  selectivity,  lambda  GSTLs  are  induced\\nonly in the meristems, whilst the phi GSTFs accumulate more dra-\\nmatically in  the  leaves.  Finally  we  have  shown  that  safeners  can  give\\na short  lived  protective  effect  to  wheat  during  the  early  stages  of\\ngermination and  growth  on  soils  contaminated  with  heavy  metals\\nand oil  residues.\\nBased on  the  observed  speed  of  the  safener  response,  it  is\\nclear that  these  compounds  must  be  rapidly  recognised  by  an  as\\nyet unknown receptor system which initiates major changes in\\ntranscription (Riechers  et  al.,  2010).  It  is  therefore  intriguing  that\\ndistinct chemical  classes  of  safeners  give  such  similar  detoxiﬁ-\\ncation responses,  suggesting  they  are  recognised  by  a  common\\nreceptor system. Recent studies in Arabidopsis with a chemical\\nseries based  on  fenclorim  were  strongly  suggestive  of  a  selec-\\ntive protein-based  receptor  system,  with  minor  changes  in  the\\nreactivity and size of the safener strongly affecting GST-inducing\\nactivity (Skipsey et al., 2011). Similarly, a protein which selec-\\ntively bound the safener dichlormid has been identiﬁed in maize,\\nthough its function remains unknown (Scott-Craig et al., 1998).\\nBoth fenclorim  and  dichlormid  show  the  characteristics  of  pro-\\ntein alkylating agents, suggesting they need to covalently bind\\nto the  receptor  target.  In  the  case  of  the  three  safeners  used  inthis study,  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  parent  compounds  would\\nserve as  alkylating  agents.  Instead  it  would  appear  more  likely\\nthat if  they  functioned  via  covalently  modifying  a  receptor  pro-\\ntein that  this  would  occur  following  the  formation  of  a  reactive\\nmetabolite. In  the  studies  with  cloquintocet  mexyl,  we  were  unable\\nto identify  any  downstream  metabolites  other  than  the  free  acid\\ncloquintocet. By  demonstrating  that  cloquintocet  was  as  active\\nat inducing  GSTs  as  the  parent  ester,  these  studies  did  demon-\\nstrate that  the  acid,  rather  than  the  ester,  was  more  likely  to  be\\nthe direct  source  of  safener  activity.  However,  the  potential  for\\na further  and  more  chemically  reactive  downstream  metabolite\\nto be  the  active  signalling  agent  is  yet  to  be  determined.  The\\ndose-dependence studies  did  show  that  there  is  a  saturable  thresh-\\nold for  the  response,  with  higher  concentrations  only  promoting\\na longer,  rather  than  a  larger,  induction  of  GST  activity.  This  is\\nsuggestive of  a  dynamic  detection  system  whereby  a  minimal  con-\\ncentration of  the  active  safening  agent  is  required  to  sustain  the\\nresponse.\\nThe differences  between  the  distribution  of  members  of  the\\ndifferent GST  families  in  leaves  and  meristems  before  and  after\\nsafening were  also  intriguing  and  potentially  important,  with\\nrespect to  the  protective  activity  of  these  compounds.  Safeners\\ntend to  protect  cereals  from  herbicides  such  as  the  AOPPs  which\\nwill predominantly  act  to  inhibit  fatty  acid  biosynthesis  in  the\\nrapidly dividing  cells  in  the  meristems.  Similarly,  other  ‘safened’\\nclasses of  herbicide  such  as  the  chloroacetanilides  (fatty  acid  elon-\\ngation inhibitors)  and  sulfonylureas  (branched  chain  amino  acid\\nsynthesis) will  be  most  potent  when  acting  on  rapidly  dividing\\nmeristematic cells.  Studies  in  the  related  T.  tauschii  have  sug-\\ngested that  the  induction  of  tau  GSTUs  in  the  cells  around  the\\ncoleoptiles is critical in deﬁning the protective activities of safeners\\n(Riechers et  al.,  2003).  It  is  therefore  interesting  that  the  induction\\nof lambda  GSTLs  is  also  speciﬁc  to  the  meristems.  The  GSTLs  have\\na well  established  but  as  yet  undeﬁned  relationship  with  safen-\\ning in  wheat  (Theodoulou  et  al.,  2003).  Recently,  we  have  shown\\nthat whilst  GSTLs  do  not  directly  detoxify  xenobiotics,  they  do  have\\nan important  antioxidant  function  in  which  they  can  couple  pro-\\ntective glutathione  thiol  and  polyphenol  metabolism  (Dixon  and\\nEdwards, 2010). The current work lends further evidence for the\\nfunctional importance of GSTLs in tolerance to chemically imposed\\nstress in  plants  and  suggests  that  such  protection  is  cell  type  spe-\\nciﬁc.\\nThe ﬁnding  that  safeners  can  stimulate  plant  growth  and  pro-\\nvide some  protection  to  wheat  germinating  in  essentially  toxic  soil\\nis also  of  potential  interest.  Several  agrochemicals,  most  notably\\nthe strobilurin fungicides, are known to give growth promoting\\neffects in  wheat  (Wu  and  von  Tiedemann,  2001).  Based  on  the\\nstudies presented  here  we  would  not  anticipate  the  safeners  to\\nhave any  long  term  yield  promoting  effects,  as  the  responses\\nthey invoke  are  too  transient.  Intriguingly,  the  growth  promoting\\nactivity must  be  distinct  from  the  suite  of  protective  responses\\nsafeners induce  in  wheat  as  shoot  growth  was  only  stimulated\\nby mefenpyr ethyl and fenchlorazole ethyl and not by cloquin-\\ntocet mexyl.  However,  the  production  of  thiols  and  antioxidant\\nsecondary metabolites  associated  with  safening  might  help  explain\\nthe protection  these  compounds  exerted  in  the  wheat  plants\\ngrown in the contaminated soil. For example the glutathione\\nknown to  accumulate  on  safening  would  be  useful  in  counteract-\\ning metal  ion  toxicity,  whilst  the  detoxiﬁcation  enzymes  would\\nprovide some protection against organic pollutants.

Present study was undertaken tore-assess the performance of drought tolerant (PRLT 2/89-33) and drought sensitive (H 77/833-2) parentsalong with two QTL-NILs (ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01040), under salinity stress speciﬁcally imposed duringpost-ﬂowering growth stages when plants had developed their ion sinks in full. Time course changes inionic accumulation and their compartmentalization in different plant parts was studied, speciﬁcally tomonitor and capture changes conferred by the two alleles at this QTL, at small intervals. Amongst differentplant parts, higher accumulation of toxic ion Na\\n+was recorded in roots. Further, the Na+concentration\\nin roots of the testcross hybrid of the drought-sensitive parent (H 77/833-2) reached its maximum atECiw 15 dS m\\n−1within 24 h after salinity imposition, whereas it continued to increase with time in the\\ntestcross hybrids of the drought tolerant parent PRLT 2/89-33 as well as those of its QTL-NILs (ICMR 01029and ICMR 01004) and reached at its maximum at 120 h stage. Comparison of differential distribution oftoxic ions in individual leaves revealed that Na\\n+ions were not uniformly distributed in the leaves of\\nthe drought-tolerant parent and drought-tolerant QTL-NILs; but accumulated preferentially in the olderleaves, whereas the hybrid of the drought-sensitive parent showed signiﬁcantly higher Na\\n+concentra-\\ntion in all main stem leaves irrespective of their age. Dynamics of chlorophyll and proline concentrationvariation studied under salt stress at late ﬂowering stages revealed a greater reduction, almost twice, inboth leaf chlorophyll and proline concentrations in younger leaves in the hybrids of the sensitive parentas compared to the tolerant parent and QTL NILs. Imposition of salinity stress even at ﬂowering stageaffected the yield performance in pearl millet, wherein higher yield was recorded in drought tolerantparent and the two QTL-NILs compared to drought sensitive parent.\\n© 2014 The Authors.

In these regions, it is predominantlygrown as a rainfed crop and severe droughts occur due to scantyand untimely rains during the cropping season. The crop partic-ularly experiences drought stress during post-ﬂowering growth.Apart from drought, areas where pearl millet is grown are oftencharacterised by saline underground waters. In times of severedrought, such brackish ground water is typically the only irrigationoption that can save the dying crop.\\nGenetic mapping studies in pearl millet have identiﬁed a major\\nquantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with maintenance of com-ponents of grain and stover yield under terminal drought stressconditions ( Yadav et al., 2002, 2004; Bidinger et al., 2007 ), and evi-\\ndence of constitutive differences in leaf abscisic acid concentrationresulting in reduced transpiration rates in genotypes having thedrought tolerance alleles at this QTL has been reported ( Kholová\\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2014.01.013\\n0098-8472/© 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/ ).P.C. Sharma et al. / Environmental and Experimental Botany 102 (2014) 48–57 49\\net al., 2010a,b ). Recently, we have established that the drought-\\ntolerance allele at this QTL also contributes to better performanceunder salinity and alkalinity stress conditions ( Sharma et al., 2011 ).\\nTestcross hybrids of the QTL donor parent (drought-tolerant PRLT2/89-33), QTL recipient parent (drought-sensitive H 77/833-2), anda set of six near-isogenic lines (NILs) derived by marker-assistedbackcross introgression into H 77/833-2 background of donor par-ent alleles in the vicinity of the terminal drought tolerance (DT)QTL (QTL-NILs) were evaluated at germination, vegetative andmaturity stages under three salinity and alkalinity levels in thatstudy ( Sharma et al., 2011 ). It was revealed that the DT-QTL alleles\\ncontributed by donor PRLT 2/89-33 exerted favourable effects ongrowth and productivity traits under conditions of salt stress rightfrom the seedling stage through to maturity, by better compart-mentalization of Na\\n+in nodes and internodes besides limiting Na+\\naccumulation in leaves.\\nDuring germination and emergence, tolerance is based on\\npercent survival, while during the later developmental stages,tolerance results from a complex interaction of multitude ofadaptation strategies involving compartmentation of toxic ions,accumulation of osmolytes and conservation of water. There-fore, the present study was undertaken to gain deeper insightsof the effects of alleles of this DT QTL under salt stress speciﬁ-cally when the stress is applied at ﬂowering and post-ﬂoweringgrowth stages and to better understand the mechanism of salinetolerance conferred by this major QTL at late ﬂowering stages.Drought-tolerant and -sensitive parents, and the two QTL-NILs(ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01040) differing for the drought toleranceQTL ( Yadav et al., 2002, 2011 ), were evaluated under post-ﬂowering\\nsalt stress conditions by imposing salinity treatments beginning at45 days after crop emergence, when ﬂowering has almost com-pleted and the plant sink is fully developed. Ionic accumulation andcompartmentalization was quantiﬁed in different plant parts as afunction of time after imposition of the stress, speciﬁcally to mon-itor and capture changes at small intervals during post-ﬂoweringgrowth conferred by two alleles at this QTL in fully developed ionsinks.\\nThe synthesis and accumulation of compatible osmolytes such\\nas proline has been reported widely as a metabolic response tomaintain osmotic pressure under salt and water stress in manyplant species ( Ramanjulu and Sudhakar, 2000; deLacerda et al.,\\n2003; Demiral and Türkan, 2005; Desingh and Kanagaraj, 2007;Koca et al., 2007; Sneha et al., 2013 ). In addition to its role as a\\ncytosolic osmolyte, proline also serves as a sink for energy to reg-ulate redox potentials, as a hydroxyl radical scavenger, and as asolute that protects macromolecules against denaturation ( Blum\\nand Ebercon, 1976; Simiroff and Cumbes, 1989; Venkamp et al.,1989 ). Therefore, besides ionic analysis, proline and chlorophyll\\nconcentrations were also assessed in individual leaves of the exper-imental materials used in this study to investigate whether theconcomitant changes, if any, occurring in their levels under salinitystress is associated with salinity tolerance.\\n2. Materials and methods\\n2.1. Plant material\\nPlant material chosen was essentially the same as described\\ninSharma et al. (2011) and Kholová et al. (2010a,b) . Testcross\\nhybrids of two parental genotypes, PRLT 2/89-33 (drought-tolerant,donor parent for drought tolerance QTL) and H 77/833-2 (drought-sensitive, recipient parent for drought tolerance QTL), and twoQTL-NILs (ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01040) were used in the detailedinvestigations reported in this study.2.2. Plant growth and salinity stress treatments\\nTen replicates of each genotype were sown directly in 20 kg\\ncapacity ceramic pots ﬁlled with sand. Initially, 15 seeds were sownin each pot. Emerged seedlings were thinned to three seedlings perpot 15 days after sowing (DAS). These plants were allowed to growunder normal conditions up to 45 DAS in a net house at the Cen-tral Soil Salinity Research Institute (CSSRI), Karnal, Haryana, India,from June to September, 2009, when natural growing conditions(temperature 25–35\\n◦C, relative humidity 60–82%) are generally\\nfavourable for pearl millet growth and development. During thisperiod, plants received irrigation daily with ¼ strength Hoaglandnutrient solution.\\nAt 45 DAS, salinity stress was initiated to study salt relations of\\nthese genotypes as a function of time at a stage when they have fullydeveloped their sink capacity under non-stress conditions. Thiswould permit study of salt uptake by the plants as well as of theircompartmentalization ability of the toxic ions in the already devel-oped and fully-expanded tissues/sink over time when confrontedwith salinity stress. At this stage, pots were divided into threesets: one set of plants received irrigation of ECiw 2.0 dS m\\n−1, while\\nthe other two received irrigation of ECiw 10.0 and 15.0 dS m−1,\\nrespectively. The saline water for irrigation was prepared by addingNaCl, Na\\n2SO4and CaCl 2, keeping Na:Ca and Cl:SO 4ratios of 4:1\\nin ¼ strength Hoagland nutrient solution as described in Sharma\\net al. (2011) . The pots were irrigated daily so as to maintain the\\nrespective salinity level in the root zone. Plants were sampleddestructively at the time of initiation of salinity stress treatments(zero hour) and thereafter at 24, 48 and 120 h following initialimposition of the salinity stress treatments.\\n2.3. Measurement of chlorophyll, proline, ion concentrations and\\nyield related parameters\\nAt each sampling, the plants were separated into stem, root and\\nthe individual leaves. For the sake of uniformity, eight leaves weresampled from each plant with basal leaf labelled as 1 and topmostleaf on the main stem as 8. The individual leaves were excisedfrom the main stem to record chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and totalchlorophyll by extraction in 80% ethanol. For measuring chloro-phyll, the extract absorbance was measured at 642 and 665 nmon a spectrophotometer and chlorophyll concentrations were cal-culated according to Arnon (1949) . Required amounts of 300 mM\\nglacial acetic acid were subsequently added to the same solutionto make ﬁnal concentrations 100 mM. The tissue was re-extractedfor 2 h at 90\\n◦C for the determination of Na+and K+concentrations\\nof the individual leaves as described in Yeo and Flowers (1983) .\\nThe ionic concentrations were also determined from main stemand root samples following wet digestion, using ﬂame spectropho-tometery as described by Sharma et al. (2011) . Four replications\\nwere used for measuring ion concentrations, which were calcu-lated as mmol g\\n−1fresh weight in case of leaves and as mmol g−1\\ndry weight in case of stem and root samples. The salinity-induced\\nchanges in proline concentrations were also recorded in differentleaves following Bates et al. (1973) .\\nSaline irrigation continued in the remaining six replications\\nuntil harvest of the crop for recording yield and yield-relatedparameters. At maturity, three plants per pot were harvested andair dried prior to recording their biomass, stover and grain yieldsas described in Yadav et al. (2002, 2004) .\\n2.4. Analysis of the data\\nStatistical analyses, including analysis of variance (ANOVA),\\nwere conducted using the statistical programme package Windo-stat ver. 8.5. Data were analysed using salinity and genotypes as50 P.C. Sharma et al. / Environmental and Experimental Botany 102 (2014) 48–57\\nFig. 1.

Genotype ×salinity ×time-course treatment interac-\\ntions were also analysed.\\n3. Results\\n3.1. Ionic accumulation in different plant parts\\nSigniﬁcant genotypic differences in ion accumulations were evi-\\ndent amongst the two parental genotypes and two QTL-NILs in allthe three plant parts ( viz.main stem, roots and leaves) in the salin-\\nity treatments and the time-course of salinity treatments appliedin this study ( Fig. 1 ).\\nTwenty-four hour after imposition of salinity stress, maximum\\nNa\\n+accumulation was recorded in roots ( Fig. 1 B) followed by\\nthe main stem ( Fig. 1 C) and leaves ( Fig. 1 D). Na+accumulation\\nincreased continuously in these plant parts with the time-courseof salinity treatments, from imposition until 120 h, both in parentalgenotypes as well as the two QTL-NILs. The salinity-sensitive par-ent H 77/833-2 recorded highest concentration of Na\\n+in roots as\\nquickly as 24 h of salinity stress imposition of ECiw 15 dS m−1and\\nthis Na+level did not increase signiﬁcantly thereafter ( Fig. 1 B). On\\nthe other hand, Na+concentration in roots of the tolerant parent\\nPRLT 2/89-33 and the QTL-NILs (ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01040)reached a lower level 24 h after imposition of the salinity stresstreatments and then continued to increase throughout the 120 htime-course.\\nNa\\n+concentrations in main stems increased both with time and\\nsalinity levels and a marked contrast was notable between testcrossgenotypes at 120 h, in the ECiw 15 dS m\\n−1treatment ( Fig. 1 C). At\\nthis salinity level, H 77/833-2 accumulated signiﬁcantly higher Na+\\nin its stems (0.99 mmol g−1dry wt) compared to PRLT 2/89-33\\n(0.67 mmol g−1dry wt). Compared to levels at the initiation of salin-\\nity stress (0.16 and 0.18 mmol g−1dry wt in sensitive and tolerant\\nparents, respectively), Na+levels in stems increased by more than\\n6-fold in the sensitive parent and around 3.7-fold in the tolerantparent. Similar to PRLT 2/89-33, the two QTL-NILs also accumulated\\nlower amounts of Na+in their main stems than H 77/833-2 ( Fig. 1 C).\\nAt 120 h after salinity treatment imposition at ECiw 15 dS m−1, the\\nmean Na+concentration in stems of H 77/833-2 was 32% higher\\nthan PRLT 2/89-33. Further, the Na/K ratio in stems of H 77/833-2,120 h after imposition of the salinity treatment of 15 dS m\\n−1, was\\n6.7 times of the value at zero h; whereas this ratio increased by 3.6and 4.9 times, in PRLT 2/89-33 and QTL-NILs, respectively.\\nIn strong contrast to roots ( Fig. 1 B) and main stems ( Fig. 1 C),\\nleaves recorded lower Na\\n+concentrations ( Fig. 1 D). Signiﬁcant\\ndifferences in Na+accumulation started to appear in leaves of\\nthe parental genotypes and the QTL-NILs at 24 and 48 h into thetime-course at ECiw 10 dS m\\n−1. However, at ECiw 15 dS m−1, non-\\nsigniﬁcant differences were observed in Na+concentration across\\nall genotypes at 24 and 48 h. It was only after 120 h that Na+accu-\\nmulation started to differ signiﬁcantly between the two parentsas H 77/833-2 and PRLT 2/89-33 had accumulated 2.2 and 1.3times more Na\\n+than at the 24 and 48 h harvests, respectively. The\\ntwo QTL-NILs, however, did not show any signiﬁcant differences inNa\\n+concentrations when harvested 24, 48 and 120 h after salinity\\nimposition at ECiw 15 dS m−1. Further, H 77/833-2 had accumu-\\nlated almost double Na+than PRLT 2/89-33 and more than two\\ntimes the QTL NILs ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01040 at 120 h aftersalinity imposition of EC 15 dS m\\n−1. Further, at the same stage and\\nsalinity level, Na/K ratio in leaves of the sensitive parent increasedto 1.9 times that of the tolerant parent and of the two QTL-NILs.\\n3.2. Ionic accumulation in individual leaves\\nSigniﬁcant differences in leaf Na\\n+concentration were evi-\\ndent across leaves, genotypes and salinity levels ( Fig. 2 ). At 24 h\\nafter initial imposition of stress, H 77/833-2 accumulated 11%higher Na\\n+concentration than PRLT 2/89-33, and the difference\\nfurther increased to 29% by 120 h after salinity treatment impo-sition. Further, the two QTL-NILs, ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01040,P.C. Sharma et al. / Environmental and Experimental Botany 102 (2014) 48–57 51\\nFig. 2. Time course changes in Na+concentration (mmol g−1leaf fresh weight) in different leaves of pearl millet parental genotypes H 77/833-2 (A) and PRLT 2/89-33 (B),\\nand QTL-NILs ICMR 01029 (C) and ICMR 01040 (D) differing for a terminal drought tolerance QTL, at three salinity levels (ECiw 2, 10 and 15 dS m−1imposed at 45 days after\\nsowing). Leaf 1 is the basal leaf and leaf 8 is the topmost leaf on the main stem.\\naccumulated 15% and 20% lower Na+concentrations, respectively,\\nthan H 77/833-2 at 24 h following salinity imposition; this differ-ence further increased with time.\\nUpon imposition of salinity stress, Na\\n+started accumulating dif-\\nferentially in leaves with the passage of time; with higher Na+\\nconcentrations in basal leaves and lower Na+concentrations in\\nleaves towards top of the main stem. The sensitive parent H77/833-2 accumulated higher Na\\n+levels, regardless of leaf posi-\\ntion, ( Fig. 2 A) than PRLT 2/89-33 ( Fig. 2 B) with increasing intensities\\nand durations of salinity stress. All the leaves of the two QTL-NILsshowed lower Na\\n+concentrations than did comparable leaves of\\neither of the two parental genotypes ( Fig. 2 ). The same trend of\\nNa+accumulation continued in different leaves 48 h after salin-\\nity imposition in the two parental genotypes as well as in the twoQTL-NILs. The most signiﬁcant observation at ECiw 10 dS m\\n−1was\\nthat the oldest leaf (leaf position 1) of PRLT 2/89-33 started toshow increased accumulation of Na\\n+after 48 h (0.32 mM) as com-\\npared to the oldest leaf of H 77/833-2 (0.23 mM). Under the samesalinity level (ECiw 10 dS m\\n−1) at 120 h harvest, signiﬁcant differ-\\nences in Na+accumulation were observed amongst the different\\ngenotypes studied. The Na+concentration of leaves continued to\\nincrease with time through 120 h at ECiw 15 dS m−1in all four\\ngenotypes evaluated. Na+concentration in the lowermost leaf was\\nhigher in PRLT 2/89-33, 24 and 48 h after salinity stress impositionthan in the comparable leaf of H 77/833-2; however, no signiﬁ-cant differences were observed in the remaining leaves. Further,signiﬁcant differences between leaf Na\\n+concentrations of the four\\ngenotypes were observed 120 h after imposition of ECiw 15 dS m−1\\nsalinity stress. The leaves at positions 1 to 7 in H 77/833-2 ( Fig. 2 A)\\nshowed two times greater Na+concentrations than did comparable\\nleaves of PRLT 2/89-33 ( Fig. 2 B). Comparison of older and younger\\nleaves in these genotypes revealed that the lowermost three leaves(leaves at position 1, 2, 3) of PRLT 2/89-33 and the QTL-NILs showedsigniﬁcantly higher Na\\n+concentrations than the uppermost ﬁve\\nleaves (leaves at position 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), whereas H 77/833-2 consis-tently showed signiﬁcantly higher Na\\n+concentrations in all leaves,\\nirrespective of their age or position ( Fig. 2 ).\\nRate of Na+accumulation in different leaves also differed\\namongst tolerant and sensitive parents as well as the QTL-NILs. Na+\\naccumulation was more rapid during the ﬁrst 24 h following salin-ity treatment imposition and slowed thereafter in all genotypes,at ECiw 10 and 15 dS m\\n−1salinity levels. Genotypes H 77/833-2\\nand PRLT 2/89-33 did not differ in their rate of Na+accumulation\\nin different leaves at ECiw 10 dS m−1. However, such differences\\nappeared with increase in salinity level to ECiw 15 dS m−1. Dur-\\ning the ﬁrst 24 h of salinity stress at ECiw15 dS m−1, both H\\n77/833-2 and PRLT 2/89-33 accumulated Na+in leaves at rates of\\n7-11 mmol g−1leaf fresh weight per hour in the basal leaves and\\n2-5 mmol g−1leaf fresh weight per hour in topmost leaves. Though\\nthis rate of Na+accumulation slowed a bit in H 77/833-2 beyond\\n24 h, a drastic reduction was recorded in PRLT 2/89-33. In the basalleaves of H 77/833-2, the rate of Na\\n+accumulation reduced from\\n11 mmol g−1leaf fresh weight per hour (0–24 h) to 8 mmol g−1leaf\\nfresh weight per hour during 48–120 h following salinity stressimposition, respectively. The comparable decline in PRLT 2/89-33was from 11 to 1 mmol g\\n−1leaf fresh weight per hour during these\\nsame intervals. Rate of Na+accumulation in different leaves of the\\ntwo QTL-NILs fell between the ranges of their donor and recurrentparents.\\nThe Na/K ratio behaved in a similar fashion in different geno-\\ntypes with respect to salinity levels, time intervals and leafpositions. This ratio declined with increase in leaf position frombase to top. In H 77/833-2, the basal leaf showed 79% higher Na/Kthan the topmost leaf 120 h after imposition of salinity stress atECiw 15 dS m\\n−1, whereas, the similar increase in PRLT 2/89-33 and\\nthe two QTL-NILs was around 56% and 69% respectively ( Table 1 ).52 P.C.

At the start of salinity stress impo-sition (0 h), all leaves at different positions recorded higher totalchlorophyll concentration values in H 77/833-2 (+47% basal leafand +10% top leaf) ( Fig. 3 A) than PRLT 2/89-33 ( Fig. 3 B) or those of\\nthe QTL-NILs (+58% basal leaf and +53% top leaf) ( Fig. 3 C, 3D).

Further, at ECiw 15 dS m\\n−1, leaf chloro-\\nphyll concentrations were much lower in H 77/833-2 ( −75% in basal\\nleaf and −40% on top leaf) than in QTL-NIL ICMR 01029. Similarly,\\nthe QTL-NIL ICMR 01040 also showed higher chlorophyll than H77/833-2 at the higher salinity level (+21% for basal leaf and +19%for top most leaf). At ECiw 15 dS m\\n−1, the mean chlorophyll concen-\\ntrations declined by 28 and 10% in H 77/833-2 and PRLT 2/89-33respectively, compared to their controls. In contrast, it increased by30 (ICMR 01040) to 39% (ICMR 01029) in the QTL-NILs. Further, thetotal chlorophyll concentrations increased in different leaves frombase to top in all the genotypes ( Fig. 3 ).\\nAccumulation of Na\\n+also affected chlorophyll concentration in\\nleaves. Tissue tolerance (measured as the leaf Na+concentration at\\nwhich 50% loss of chlorophyll occurred) varied amongst genotypesand across time intervals after salinity stress imposition. At ECiw15 dS m\\n−1, 50% loss of chlorophyll occurred at Na+concentration\\nof 0.34 mmol g−1fresh weight in leaves of H 77/833-2, whereas\\nsimilar loss occurred at Na+concentration of 0.40 mmol g−1fresh\\nweight in PRLT 2/89-33 after 24 h of salinity stress (data not shown).The same trend was also observed after 48 and 120 h of salinity\\nstress. The tissue tolerance values were 0.38 and 0.54 mmol g−1\\nfresh weight in H 77/833-2 and PRLT 2/89-33 respectively, after\\n48 h of stress imposition. The tissue tolerance values were alsocomputed from earlier experiment ( Sharma et al., 2011 ) under\\nlong-term salt stress, in which plants were raised under salinitystress from germination stage onwards. In leaves of H 77/833-2, Na\\n+concentration required for 50% loss of chlorophyll was\\n0.12 mmol g−1fresh weight, whereas similar loss in chlorophyll\\nrequired 0.16 mmol Na+g−1fresh weight in PRLT 2/89-33 ( Fig. 4 A).\\nSimilarly, the two QTL-NILs required 0.14 (ICMR 01029) and 0.15(ICMR 01040) mmol g\\n−1fresh weight leaf Na+, to cause 50% chloro-\\nphyll loss.\\n3.4. Proline concentrations in leaves\\nLeaf proline concentration increased with increase in salinity\\nlevel and duration of salinity stress in all the genotypes evaluated.Signiﬁcant differences in proline concentrations were recordedfor the four genotypes in harvests made at zero and 24 h aftersalinity imposition, whereas at 48 and 120 h, non-signiﬁcant differ-ences were recorded ( Fig. 5 ). Further, signiﬁcant differences were\\nobserved for both salinity treatments (ECiw 10 and 15 dS m\\n−1)a t\\nharvests taken 24, 48 and 120 h after salinity imposition. Com-pared to the zero h harvest, after 120 h of salinity stress at ECiw15 dS m\\n−1, the mean proline concentration (mean of individual\\nleaves) had increased by 52% in H 77/833-2, whereas the com-parable increase was 87% in PRLT 2/89-33. Further, PRLT 2/89-33showed 22% higher proline concentration in different leaves (onmean basis) than H 77/833-2 120 h after imposition of the ECiw15 dS m\\n−1salinity treatment. Similarly, the two QTL-NILs recorded\\n19 (ICMR 01029) and 14% (ICMR 01040) higher leaf proline concen-trations than H 77/833-2 120 h after imposition of this treatment.Comparison of proline concentrations in individual leaves revealedhigher proline levels in younger leaves than in older leaves as salin-ity stress increased. Genotype PRLT 2/89-33 showed almost twicethe proline concentration in younger leaves at 48 and 120 h afterimposition of salinity stress than H 77/833-2, at both salinity levels(ECiw 10 and 15 dS m\\n−1, data not shown). The QTL-NILs, however,\\ndid not show any discernible patterns for proline distribution inindividual leaves.P.C. Sharma et al. / Environmental and Experimental Botany 102 (2014) 48–57 53\\nFig. 3.

Stover and seed yield\\nInterestingly, the imposition of salinity even at ﬂowering stage\\n(45 DAS) affected the pearl millet yield performance.

Signiﬁcant genotypic differences were evident for\\nboth stover and grain yield under salinity stress on per plant aswell as on per pot basis. Compared to the control (ECiw 2 dS m\\n−1),\\nstover yield at ECiw 15 dS m−1declined by 65% in H 77/833-2 and\\nby 44% in PRLT 2/89-33. This decline in the two QTL-NILs was 37%(ICMR 01029) and 52% (ICMR 01040), respectively. Compared to H77/833-2, PRLT 2/89-33 recorded 57% higher stover yield at ECiw15 dS m\\n−1. Further, the two QTL-NILs showed 60% (ICMR 01029)\\nand 21% (ICMR 01040) higher stover yield than H 77/833-2 at ECiw15 dS m\\n−1. Similar trend was also observed for grain yield. Geno-\\ntype PRLT 2/89-33 showed 32% higher grain yield (per plant) thanH 77/833-2 at ECiw 15 dS m\\n−1(Fig. 6 ). Similarly, the two QTL-NILs\\n(ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01040) recorded 32 and 33% higher grainyield, respectively, than H 77/833-2 at ECiw 15 dS m\\n−1.\\n4. Discussion\\nWe have shown previously that the major terminal drought\\ntolerance (DT) QTL on pearl millet linkage group 2 (LG 2) exertsfavourable effects on growth of drought-tolerant parent PRLT2/89-33 and its QTL-NILs (introgressed with the LG 2 DT-QTLfrom drought-tolerant parent PRLT 2/89-33) right from germina-tion and seedling emergence through to maturity under varyingsalinity and alkalinity stress conditions as well, by limiting Na\\n+\\naccumulation in leaves and by partitioning these into nodes andinternodes of the stem ( Sharma et al., 2011 ). Further, it has been\\ndemonstrated that the drought-tolerant parent allele of this QTLis associated with constitutively increased leaf ABA concentration(Kholová et al., 2010a ) and reduced transpiration rates ( Kholová\\net al., 2010b ). The focus of our present study was to improve\\nour understanding of how the tolerant parent allele cope withhigh salt stress, particularly when applied at reproductive growthstages. For this, we have imposed more severe salt stress (ECiw15 dS m\\n−1) than before (up to ECiw 12 dS m−1,Sharma et al.,\\n2011 ), during late ﬂowering and post-ﬂowering growth stages\\nfollowing development of sink strength on main stem panicles,and studied the time course of changes in ion accumulation indifferent ion sinks (individual leaves, main stem and roots), toassess the differences in ion uptake and distribution in differentplant parts and on yield parameters. We also focused on under-standing the dynamics of chlorophyll and proline concentrationvariation, if any, associated with this DT-QTL under salt stress at\\nlate ﬂowering stages.\\nThe three most signiﬁcant observations made in the present\\nstudy were as follows: ﬁrst, the roots accumulated high Na\\n+con-\\ncentrations (means across salinity levels and time periods) in thepresent study (0.40 mmol g\\n−1dry weight), which is approximately\\nat par with the Na+accumulated in the main stem (0.39 mmol g−1\\ndry weight). It is in marked contrast to our previous results,\\nwhere main stems accumulated 24% higher Na+concentrations\\nthan roots on a mean basis ( Sharma et al., 2011 ). In the present\\nstudy of short-term salinity stress applied during late ﬂoweringand post-ﬂowering growth stages, the drought-sensitive parent H77/833-2 accumulated 9% higher Na\\n+concentration in its roots\\nthan the drought-tolerant parent PRLT 2/89-33, whereas in theprevious study involving long-term salinity application through-out the plant growth cycle, this trend was exactly reversed. Thesedifferences in the present and previous results suggest differentmechanisms involved in counteracting salinity stress applied atdifferent growth stages. The reduced transpiration rates reportedin drought-tolerant parent and the two QTL-NILs, as a result ofconstitutively enhanced foliar ABA levels ( Kholová et al., 2010a,b ),\\ncould explain the differences observed in both the short-term andlong-term salinity stress treatments.\\nThe second noteworthy observation made was that Na\\n+con-\\ncentration in roots of H 77/833-2 reached its maximum at ECiw15 dS m\\n−1within 24 h after salinity imposition. However, root Na+\\ncontinued to increase with time in PRLT 2/89-33 and QTL-NILs\\n(ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01004) from 24 to 120 h and reached atits maximum at 120 h stage ( Fig. 1 B). Conclusively, though both\\nparents accumulated similar levels of Na\\n+in their roots after 120 h\\nat ECiw 15 dS m−1, higher rate of Na+accumulation in roots of H\\n77/833-2 results in greater negative impact on its growth and pro-ductivity compared to PRLT 2/89-33 and two QTL-NILs. Further,after 120 h at ECiw 15 dS m\\n−1, the Na/K ratio was 8.5 times that\\nof the initial value in roots of H 77/833-2 while similar increasein PRLT 2/89-33 and two QTL-NILs was 6.5 and 7 times, respec-tively. Such clear differences in the roots of parental genotypeswere not observed previously ( Sharma et al., 2011 ), mainly because\\nthe root growth occurred under normal conditions until 45 DAS inthe present study, providing a higher root capacity to accumulatethese toxic ions.\\nDifferential accumulation of Na\\n+was clearly evident in the\\nmain stem and individual leaves of the two parental genotypesas well the QTL NILs. Na\\n+accumulation was 6 times higher in\\nthe main stem of H 77/833-2 120 h after imposition of the ECiw15 dS m\\n−1salinity stress, whereas it increased by 3.5 times in PRLTP.C.

Stover and seed weight (g plant−1) in pearl millet parental genotypes (H 77/833-2 and PRLT 2/89-33), and QTL-NILs (ICMR 01029 and ICMR 01040) differing for a\\nterminal drought tolerance QTL, at three salinity levels (ECiw 2, 10 and 15 dS m−1imposed at 45 days after sowing).\\n2/89-33. Similar increases in the two QTL-NILs were 3.5- and 4.5-\\nfold respectively. These observations could be a simple function ofthe drought-tolerant parent and those of the QTL-NILs having lowertranspiration rates than the drought-sensitive parent [as reportedbyKholová et al. (2010a,b) , but not measured in the present study],\\nand so drawing in less salt while taking up soil water to supporttranspiration.\\nComparison of Na\\n+concentrations amongst different leaves on\\nmain stems revealed differential distribution of ions between oldand young leaves. The oldest leaf (leaf position 1) of PRLT 2/89-33 (Fig. 2 B) started to show increased Na\\n+concentration at ECiw\\n10 dS m−1and stored Na+at twice the concentration as found in\\nthe oldest leaves of H 77/833-2 48 h after imposition of salinitystress ( Fig. 2 A). When compared with the drought-sensitive par-\\nent at 120 h, Na\\n+concentration in the lowermost leaf (leaf position\\n1) in the drought-tolerant parent and the two QTL-NILs was two-fold greater. Most signiﬁcantly, comparison of older and youngerleaves in the genotypes at ECiw 15 dS m\\n−1revealed that the low-\\nermost three leaves (leaf positions 1, 2, 3) on the main stem ofthe drought-tolerant parent and the two QTL-NILs showed signiﬁ-cantly higher Na\\n+concentrations than the uppermost ﬁve younger\\nleaves (leaf positions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) on the same main stems 120 hafter salinity stress imposition. These results indicated that Na\\n+\\nions were not uniformly distributed in the leaves of the drought-tolerant parent and drought-tolerant QTL-NILs; but accumulatedpreferentially in the older leaves, whereas the drought-sensitiveparent showed signiﬁcantly higher Na\\n+concentration in all main\\nstem leaves irrespective of their age ( Fig. 2 ).\\nWe observed therefore that with the increase in imposed salin-\\nity level from ECiw 10 to 15 dS m−1, the drought-tolerant parent\\nshowed consistency in its control of the distribution of Na+amongst\\nits older and younger leaves, with successively younger leaves tak-ing the least share of the salt stress. However, similar consistencywas not shown by drought-sensitive parent. Storing Na\\n+preferen-\\ntially in older leaves and limiting transmission of salt into youngerleaves in drought-tolerant parent and the two QTL-NILs served asa protective mechanism. Controlled uptake and better compart-mentalization of Na\\n+besides the ability to maintain low Na+/K+\\nhave been described as important mechanisms of salt tolerancein plants ( Munns and Tester, 2008; deVos et al., 2013 ). Similar\\ndifferential distribution of Na\\n+ions between old (expanded) and\\nyoung (expanding) leaves of plants grown under high-salinity con-ditions has been reported in other salt-tolerant crops ( Greenway\\net al., 1965, 1966; Yeo and Flowers, 1986; Soliman and Dos, 1992;Nakamura et al., 1996; Ramanjulu and Sudhakar, 2001; Kumar et al.,\\n2003 ).\\nVarious studies have reported varietal differences with respect\\nto the decline in leaf chlorophyll concentration under increasingsalinity stress as well as under increased leaf Na\\n+concentration\\n(Yeo and Flowers, 1983; Lutts et al., 1996; Netondo et al., 2004 ). The\\npresent results showed higher leaf chlorophyll concentration in thedrought-sensitive parent H 77/833-2 than in the drought-tolerantparent PRLT 2/89-33 and two QTL-NILs at the start of salinity stressimposition (0 h). However, H 77/833-2 showed greater reduction inleaf chlorophyll concentration than PRLT 2/89-33 under short-term(present experiment) as well as under long-term salt stress ( Sharma\\net al., 2011 ). The stability of leaf chlorophyll, being membrane-\\nbound, is dependent upon membrane stability, which under salineconditions is seldom maintained. It was shown in rice that cellultrastructure differs in its stability under varying leaf Na\\n+concen-\\ntration, causing higher loss of chlorophyll in salt-sensitive varieties(Yeo and Flowers, 1986 ). There were also large varietal differences\\nin the average tissue Na\\n+concentration associated with 50% leaf\\nchlorophyll loss; higher leaf Na+is required to bring about a 50%\\nloss of chlorophyll in salt-tolerant varieties than in salt-sensitiverice varieties ( Flowers et al., 1985; Yeo and Flowers, 1986; Lutts\\net al., 1996 ). Under short term salinity stress in pearl millet, higher\\nleaf Na\\n+was required to cause 50% loss in chlorophyll in drought-\\ntolerant parent than drought-sensitive parent, at 24 and 48 h aftersalinity imposition, whereas, the tissue tolerance values of the twoQTL-NILs did not fall in between the values of the two parents.However, the tissue tolerance values computed from long term saltstress in pearl millet showed 50% loss of chlorophyll at leaf Na\\n+of\\n0.12 mmol g−1fresh weight in H 77/833-2, and 0.16 mmol in PRLT\\n2/89-33 and the two QTL NILs. The short-term salinity stress did notshow such trends in tissue tolerance mainly because the stress wasimposed at a later growth stage (45 DAS) when the leaves were fullyexpanded. Chlorophyll concentration, however, is not necessarilyan exhaustive index of tissue tolerance. Indeed, Yeo et al. (1985)\\ndemonstrated that in rice genotypes, photosynthesis was reducedby half at a leaf Na\\n+concentration that did not reduce chlorophyll\\nlevels.\\nMany investigators have demonstrated the osmo-protective\\nrole of proline at the whole-plant level and in cell cultures ( Kishore\\net al., 1995; Misra and Gupta, 2005; Szabados and Savouré, 2010 ).\\nIncreased proline content in transgenic plants is associated withenhanced tolerance to various abiotic stresses ( Kishore et al., 1995;\\nKasukawe et al., 2004 ). In the presence of low water potentials56 P.C. Sharma et al. / Environmental and Experimental Botany 102 (2014) 48–57\\nunder salinity stress, the accumulation of compatible osmolytes\\ninvolved in osmoregulation allows additional water to be taken upfrom the environment, thus buffering the immediate effect of watershortage within the plant. In the present study, at ECiw 15 dS m\\n−1,\\nthe proline concentration had increased by 52% after 120 h of salin-ity stress in H 77/833-2, whereas the comparable increase was 87%in PRLT 2/89-33 ( Fig. 5 ). The two QTL-NILs showed the pattern\\nsimilar to the drought-tolerant parent.\\nThe parallel increase in proline concentration with decreased\\nNa\\n+concentration in younger leaves of PRLT 2/89-33 and the two\\nQTL NILs suggests that this differential distribution of salt and pro-line together between young and old leaves ( i.e., an increase in\\nthe level of salt in old leaves, and an accumulation of proline inyoung leaves) is allowing the younger leaves to support sufﬁcientmetabolic and physiological activity through osmotic adjustmentfor survival under high-salinity conditions. Leaf proline concen-tration also increased under increasing long-term root zone saltstress. However, the behaviour of the genotypes with this DT QTLallele in terms of proline accumulation was exactly opposite underlong-term and short-term salt stress. Though the drought-sensitiveparent showed higher proline concentrations than the drought-tolerant parent under long-term salt stress, the sensitive parentrequired higher leaf Na\\n+than the tolerant parent to produce the\\nsame level of proline, as shown in Fig. 4 B. For example, the sen-\\nsitive parent required 0.053 mmol Na+g−1leaf fresh weight to\\nproduce 1.00 mg proline, g−1leaf fresh weight, whereas the simi-\\nlar level of proline was produced by 0.033 mmol Na+g−1leaf fresh\\nweight in the tolerant parent. The results are in accordance withthe studies where free proline increased appreciably in salt toler-ant plants ( Kumar et al., 2003; Demiral and Türkan, 2005; Misra\\nand Gupta, 2005; Koca et al., 2007; Veeranagamallaiah et al., 2007 )\\nand also where salt-sensitive cultivars accumulated signiﬁcantlyhigher levels of proline compared to tolerant ones ( Lutts et al., 1999;\\ndeLacerda et al., 2003; Vaidyanathan et al., 2003 ) as the proline con-\\ncentration differences between tolerant and sensitive genotypesdepends up on the timing of onset, severity, and duration of theimposed stress.\\n5. Conclusions\\nIn total, our results suggest that the hybrid of drought-tolerant\\nparent PRLT 2/89-33 performed better under post-ﬂowering salin-ity stress by differentially regulating Na\\n+accumulation in roots,\\nbetter compartmentalization of accumulated Na+in the main stem,\\nlimiting translocation of Na+from older leaves to metabolically\\nactive younger leaves, and restriction of Na+inﬂux and its effective\\nefﬂux in leaves through osmotic adjustment facilitated by adjustedaccumulation of proline. These ﬁndings are compatible with theearlier observation that the LG 2 drought tolerance QTL allele of thisparent is associated with constitutively elevated leaf ABA levels andreduced leaf transpirations rates.\\nAcknowledgements\\nThe work reported in this study was conducted under “Col-\\nlaborative Project with Scientists & Technologists of Indian OriginAbroad” (CP-STIO) award to P.C.S. and R.S.Y. by the Departmentof Science and Technology (DST), Government of India.

Introduction\\nTrees and shrubs growing in the cerrado, or the Brazilian\\nsavanna, which is characterized by wet (October–March) and\\ndry (April–September) seasons, have to adjust their morpho-\\nphysiological traits seasonally to successfully cope with the soil\\nwater availability. The cerrado vegetation is a vertically structured\\nmosaic of grassland, scrubland, and dense woodland physiog-\\nnomies (Haridasan, 2008). The soils of these areas are deep, acidic,\\nsandy, contain low levels of organic matter and phosphorus, and\\nare rich in aluminum (Haridasan, 2008).\\n∗Corresponding author.

Under such conditions, paraheliotropic leaf move-\\nment is one of the strategies used by many plants. Diaheliotropic\\nleaves, which are oriented at an angle perpendicular to incom-\\ning light, maximize light interception, while paraheliotropic leaves,\\nwhich orient parallel to the light, minimize it (Koller, 1986, 1990;\\nBielenberg et al., 2003; Pastenes et al., 2005; Arena et al., 2008 ).\\nIn leguminous species, paraheliotropic leaf movements are\\nrapidly induced by unfavorable conditions. In beans, leaf para-\\nheliotropism is induced by water deﬁcit (Pastenes et al., 2005),\\nleaf heat and excess sunlight interception (Bielenberg et al., 2003).\\nIn the soybean, leaf paraheliotropism is induced with increasing\\nirradiance (Jiang et al., 2006). For leguminous cerrado species,\\nparaheliotropism may be a strategy to avoid excess sunlight inter-\\nception at noon (Caldas et al., 1997; Rodrigues and Machado, 2006),\\n0098-8472/© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Habermann et al. / Environmental and Experimental Botany 71 (2011) 10–17 11\\nwhich reinforces the photo-protective role of paraheliotropism.\\nEven the leaf wilting movement of non-leguminous species, suchas cotton plants, confers photo-protection and maintains carbonassimilation ( Zhang et al., 2010 ).\\nAnother leguminous species, Robinia pseudoacacia exhibits\\nparaheliotropic leaf movement at high irradiance levels ( Liu et al.,\\n2007 ), reducing light interception and leaf temperature ( Arena\\net al., 2008 ). However, paraheliotropic leaves of R. pseudoacacia\\nshow higher stomatal conductance ( gs) and CO\\n2assimilation rates\\n(A), which are attributed to a higher photochemical performance of\\nunrestrained paraheliotropic leaves, compared to restrained leaves(Arena et al., 2008 ).\\nHowever, the physiological role of paraheliotropism may not\\nbe universal. Styrax camporum , a non-leguminous species from the\\ncerrado, possesses leaves that are always diaheliotropic as well asother leaves that assume a paraheliotropic position from 10:00 hto 17:00 h ( Habermann et al., 2008 ). Paraheliotropic leaves of this\\nspecies have higher Aand transpiration rates ( E) compared to the\\ndiaheliotropic leaves, although this high Ehas a weak relationship\\nwith the reduction in leaf temperature ( Habermann et al., 2008 ).\\nThis study also demonstrated compact spongy parenchyma in bothleaf types, and a rise in Awith the increase of irradiance for parahe-\\nliotropic leaves. Thus, this species might exploit the paraheliotropicleaf movement to enhance light use efﬁciency.\\nIn the present study, we hypothesized that, compared to diahe-\\nliotropic leaves, the paraheliotropic leaves of S. camporum would\\nshow higher values of gas exchange rates if measured with lightintercepted by adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces. Measurements ofgas exchange with devices that enabled artiﬁcial light intercep-tion only by adaxial or abaxial leaf surfaces (LI-6400 Irga with a6400-02B red/blue LED light source) and with devices that enabledsunlight interception by both leaf sides (LI-6200 Irga with a trans-parent 6000-12 one liter chamber) were performed in April 2006,in Botucatu-SP and Corumbataí-SP, Brazil. The leaf water potential,the leaf temperature of para- and diaheliotropic leaves, and the rel-ative reﬂected light intensity of adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces ofS.camporum were also measured. Anatomical and ultra-structural\\nleaf analyses were performed as a framework for the functionalstudies (see online supplementary information, Fig. S1 ).\\n2. Materials and methods\\n2.1. Site description\\nThis study was conducted using adult plants of S. camporum\\nPohl. from cerrado fragments characterized by scattered trees andshrubs and a large proportion of grassland (“closed ﬁeld”) in themunicipalities of Botucatu, São Paulo (SP) state, Brazil (22\\n◦51/primeS,\\n48◦26/primeW) and Corumbataí, SP state, Brazil (22◦13/primeS, 47◦37/primeW).\\nFive individual plants between 1.5 and 2-m tall from each of\\nthese sites were used. Plants were completely leafy at the begin-ning of the fall season in April 2006, when the measurements wereobtained.\\n2.2. Leaf angle measurement\\nIn order to classify leaves as para- or diaheliotropic, the petiole\\nangle formed with the horizon was measured. A ﬁne wire was posi-tioned between the petiole and a ruler with a water level, whichrepresented the horizon. The curvature radius formed by the wiremirrored the petiole angle. Then, the angle deﬁned by the wire wasreproduced on paper and determined with a goniometer, similar tothe method presented by Arena et al. (2008) .\\nLeaves showing petiole angle greater than 50\\n◦were classiﬁed as\\nparaheliotropic leaves, which were marked on each plant at noonon the day before the measurements were performed. Leaves dis-\\nplaying a petiole angle between 0◦and 10◦were considered as\\ndiaheliotropic. Both leaf types occurred on woody stems, and hadmature fully expanded leaf blades. Very young and very old leaveswere avoided.\\n2.3. Leaf gas exchange measurements\\nGas exchange was measured using an infrared gas analyzer (LI-\\n6200, LI-Cor, USA) with a 6000-12 one liter chamber, which is madeof Lexan\\n®and MargardTMtransparent materials. These materials\\nhave a transmittance of 90% in the visible and near infra-red spectra,but bellow 450 nm it falls markedly to 60% at 400 nm ( Li-Cor, 1990 ).\\nTherefore, this leaf cuvette enables sunlight absorptance from 300to 1100 nm ( Li-Cor, 1990 ). This leaf cuvette has inserts which were\\nused to ﬁx leaf area to 6 cm\\n2(a predetermined size), allowing faster\\nmeasurements and exposure of adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces todirect sunlight or diffuse irradiance (soil reﬂection and scatteredirradiance). Additionally, gas exchange was also measured with aninfra-red gas analyzer (LI-6400, Li-Cor, USA) using a leaf cuvettethat enables artiﬁcial red and blue LED light (6400-02B, Li-Cor, USA)interception by only one of the leaf surfaces. The 6400-02B red bluelight source spectral output has one peak centered at about 670 nmand a secondary peak at about 465 nm ( Li-Cor, 2004 ).\\nBecause paraheliotropic leaves were not ﬂat on both sides of the\\nmidrib, and showed different inclination planes, it was not possibleto measure just one of the leaf sides of the midrib without disturb-ing the leaf planes. Otherwise, it would not match the minimumarea necessary to make measurements in gas exchange chambers.Thus, the leaf planes of paraheliotropic leaves became entirely ﬂatwhen leaf cuvettes of both equipments were closed. However, thepetiole angle was not disturbed. Diaheliotropic leaves were nat-urally completely ﬂat, following the petiole angle, which was notdisturbed as well.\\nCO\\n2assimilation ( A) and transpiration ( E) rates, stomatal con-\\nductance ( gs), and intercellular CO 2(Ci) were determined by the\\nIrgas’ data analysis programs, which employ the Von Caemmerer\\nand Farquhar (1981) general gas exchange equations for both\\nequipments. The photosynthetic radiation use efﬁciency (PhRUE),was also calculated (See online supplementary data for moredetails about the method for calculating PhRUE, Table S1 ). Both\\nleaf cuvettes had external quantum sensors, which were used tomeasure the incoming sunlight. In the case of the leaf cuvette thatenabled light interception by both leaf sides, the quantum sensormeasured ambient PPFD intercepted by leaves. The leaf cuvette thatenabled artiﬁcial light interception by only one of the leaf sides wasset to provide 1800 /H9262mol photons m\\n−2s−1, as ambient PPFD varied\\nfrom 1000 to 1600 /H9262mol photons m−2s−1. The leaf temperature ( Tl)\\nwas obtained using a small thermocouple within the leaf cuvettesof both systems, according to Bielenberg et al. (2003) .\\nCurves of A,gs, and Cias a function of the PPFD values estab-\\nlished in the leaf cuvette that enables artiﬁcial light interceptionby only one of the leaf sides were also constructed to detect thesole responses of the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces of para- anddiaheliotropic leaves. These curves were generated at a controlledleaf temperature (25 ±1\\n◦C).\\n2.4. Estimation of leaf reﬂectance\\nAn estimation of the relative intensity of reﬂected light from\\nboth leaf sides was performed using a ﬂuorometer (Cary Eclipse,Varian, USA), which detects scattered light reﬂected within thesame spectrum ( /NAK) of incident light. Five young one-year-old S.\\ncamporum potted plants were maintained under natural sunlight.\\nAs no previous differences were detected from the same leaf surfacebetween para- or diaheliotropic leaves, one randomly selected leaf12 G. Habermann et al. / Environmental and Experimental Botany 71 (2011) 10–17\\nfrom each of the ﬁve plants was detached and immediately inserted\\ninto the equipment. The angle between the leaf and light beam wasclose (but not exactly) to 45\\n◦, so that reﬂected light intensity could\\nnot saturate the detector.\\n2.5. Leaf water potential\\nThe leaf water potential at predawn ( /TABpd) and midday (when\\nthe vapor pressure deﬁcit, VPD, was maximum) ( /TABmd) were mea-\\nsured by the pressure chamber method ( Turner, 1981 ) using a\\nDIK-7000 (Daiki Kogyo, Japan) pressure chamber.\\n2.6. Data analysis\\nStatistical analysis was carried out using two leaves randomly\\nselected from ﬁve plants (replicates) within an area of ﬁve hectares(ha) in Botucatu and 37 ha in Corumbataí. Gas exchange variables(A,E,gs, and Ci),T\\nl,/TABpd, and /TABmdwere determined (mean and stan-\\ndard deviation), and they were then subjected to one-way analysisof variance (comparisons between para- and diaheliotropic leaves),followed by the Tukey’s test ( P< 0.05).\\n2.7. Light and electron microscopy\\nSee online supplementary data for more details about the meth-\\nods used for obtaining and analyzing light and electron microscopicimages ( Fig. S1 ).\\n3. Results\\n3.1. Morpho-anatomical traits\\nLeaves of S. camporum are almost all diaheliotropic, but some\\nmature fully expanded leaves assume paraheliotropic positionfrom 10:00 h to 17:00 h. These mature completely expanded para-and diaheliotropic leaves are observed on woody stems, and alsoon primary branches of adult plants ( Fig. S1a ).\\nYoung leaves of S. camporum presented the trichome indumen-\\ntum on both surfaces of the leaf blade ( Fig. S1b ), while mature fully\\nexpanded leaves displayed a glabrous adaxial surface, regardless ofits heliotropic position ( Fig. S1d ).\\nThe mesophyll of both young ( Fig. S1c ) and mature\\n(Figs. S1d and e ) leaves was differentiated into a unistratiﬁed\\npalisade and a two- to three-layered spongy chlorenchyma.Spongy parenchyma cells showed numerous wall ingrowths(Figs. S1d and e ), which developed into slit-like gas spaces. Such\\ncells presented thin walls and a peripheral cytoplasm with numer-ous chloroplasts ( Fig. S1e ) and a single central vacuole that could\\nbe translucent or dense if ﬁlled with phenolic substances. Seeonline supplementary data ( Fig. S1 ) for details.\\n3.2. Gas exchange variables\\nWhen the leaves were measured with light interception by both\\nleaf sides, the CO\\n2assimilation rate ( A) was signiﬁcantly higher for\\npara- than for diaheliotropic leaves at 9:00 h, 11:00 h, and 14:00 h,but Awas similar between leaf types at the end of the day ( Fig. 1 a).\\nThe stomatal conductance ( gs) and transpiration rates ( E) followed\\nalmost the same response pattern ( Fig. 1 c and e), with parahe-\\nliotropic leaves demonstrating higher values than diaheliotropicleaves during most parts of the day. Paraheliotropic leaves exhib-ited a signiﬁcant lower value of internal CO\\n2(Ci) compared to\\ndiaheliotropic leaves, but only at 9:00 h ( Fig. 1 g).\\nLeaves measured with light interception by only the adaxial leaf\\nsurface demonstrated similar Avalues for para- and diaheliotropic\\nleaves throughout the day, except at 11:00 h, when paraheliotropicleaves exhibited a higher Acompared to diaheliotropic leaves\\n(Fig. 1 b). For gsand E, differences were detected only at 9:00 h\\nand 14:00 h, respectively ( Fig. 1 d and f). Internal CO 2concentra-\\ntions were similar in para- and diaheliotropic leaves, with the lattershowing greater values at 14:00 h, although this increase was notsigniﬁcantly higher than the CO\\n2concentrations in paraheliotropic\\nleaves ( Fig. 1 h).\\nVariations in gsdid not seem to inﬂuence the Aof leaves mea-\\nsured with sunlight interception by both leaf sides; daily resultsrevealed a conserved low gsrange with respective low carbon\\nassimilation rates for diaheliotropic leaves, while most of the datafor paraheliotropic leaves demonstrated a higher gsrange with\\nrespective higher CO\\n2assimilation rates ( Fig. 2 a). In contrast, when\\nleaves were measured with light interception by only the adax-ial leaf surface, increases in gsresulted in greater CO\\n2assimilation\\nrates, regardless of the leaf type ( Fig. 2 b).\\nThe Civalues of leaves measured with sunlight interception by\\nboth leaf sides were not dependent on gs(Fig. 3 a). However, when\\nleaves were measured with light interception by only the adaxialleaf surface, Ciﬂuctuated between 200 and 300 /H9262mol mol\\n−1, and\\nthis effect was dependent on gs(Fig. 3 b).\\nSimilarly, Awas not inﬂuenced by Ciin either paraheliotropic or\\ndiaheliotropic leaves intercepting light by both leaf sides ( Fig. 4 a);\\nbut when measuring gas exchange with light interception by onlythe adaxial leaf side, increases in Ciresulted in greater carbon\\nassimilation rates, regardless of the leaf type ( Fig. 4 b).\\nBoth surfaces of para- and diaheliotropic leaves displayed a sim-\\nilar ( P< 0.05) Afrom 0 to 100 PPFD; but from 200 to 1800 /H9262mol\\nphotons m\\n−2s−1, diaheliotropic leaves showed signiﬁcantly higher\\n(P< 0.05) Afor the adaxial than for the abaxial side ( Fig. 5 a). The\\nadaxial surface, compared to the abaxial surface of paraheliotropicleaves, showed a higher ( P< 0.05) Awithin the range of 200 and\\n800/H9262mol photons m\\n−2s−1; however, from 1000 to 1800 PPFD,\\nadaxial and abaxial sides of the paraheliotropic leaves exhibited asimilar ( P< 0.05) A(Fig. 5 a). Regarding the gs/PPFD curves, adaxial\\nand abaxial sides of both leaf types presented similar ( P< 0.05) val-\\nues at each PPFD ( Fig. 5 b). For Ci, the abaxial side presented greater\\nvalues than the adaxial side for only diaheliotropic leaves, consid-ering a range between 200 and 800 /H9262mol photons m\\n−2s−1; from\\n1000 to 1800 PPFD, both surfaces of the two leaf types had similar(P< 0.05) Civalues ( Fig. 5 c).\\nThe photosynthetic radiation use efﬁciency (PhRUE) was higher\\nin paraheliotropic than in diaheliotropic leaves at every time of dayconsidered, when the leaves were measured with sunlight inter-ception by both leaf sides. However, when leaves were artiﬁciallyilluminated only on the adaxial leaf surface, PhRUE was the samebetween para- and diaheliotropic leaves, except at 11:00 h, whenparaheliotropic leaves presented increased PhRUE in relation todiaheliotropic leaves. See online supplementary data ( Table S1 ) for\\ndetails.\\n3.3. Leaf temperature\\nThe leaf temperature remained between 30\\n◦C and 38◦C for\\nleaves measured when light intercepted both leaf sides, and para-heliotropic leaves demonstrated lower values than diaheliotropicleaves only at 11:00 h and 16:00 h ( Fig. 6 a). When leaves were mea-\\nsured with light interception by only the adaxial leaf side, the leaftemperature ﬂuctuated between 25\\n◦C and 32◦C, although no sig-\\nniﬁcant differences between leaf types were detected throughoutthe day ( Fig. 6 b).\\n3.4.

Leaf reﬂectance\\nReﬂectance from both leaf sides showed a similar response\\npattern, showing the peak of reﬂectance in the green spectrum(550 nm). The relative light intensity reﬂected from the abaxialleaf surface was signiﬁcantly higher than light reﬂected from theadaxial leaf surface within the visible light (400–700 nm). How-ever, considering wavelengths of 200–400 nm and 700–800 nm,reﬂectance was similar between both leaf surfaces ( Fig. 8 ).4. Discussion\\n4.1.

Leaf temperature\\nForseth and Teramura (1986) estimated that naturally orient-\\ning leaves of Pueraria lobata would maintain temperatures up to\\n7◦C lower than horizontally restrained leaves. However, when S.\\ncamporum leaves were illuminated on both sides, the low leaf tem-\\nperature ( Tl) observed in paraheliotropic leaves at 16:00 h seemed\\nto have a weak relationship with Eor gs, which were similar\\nbetween the leaf types ( Fig. 1 c and e). Habermann et al. (2008)\\nnoted that S. camporum paraheliotropic leaves illuminated on both\\nleaf sides had lower Tland higher E,gs, and Aduring part of the day\\ncompared to diaheliotropic leaves, but neither Enor gswas respon-\\nsible for the low Tlof paraheliotropic leaves, and there was no\\nindication that the low Tlexplained their high A. When leaves were\\nmeasured with light interception only on the adaxial leaf sides,no differences in T\\nlwere noted between para- and diaheliotropic\\nleaves ( Fig. 6 b), even when evaluated for an entire year (March,\\nApril, June, August, and October) (data not shown). Tlfor the vertical\\nleaﬂets of P. pubescens at midday was only 1.5◦C lower compared\\nto horizontal leaﬂets ( Caldas et al., 1997 ). For Arena et al. (2008) ,\\nthe reduction in Tlcaused by paraheliotropism may be relevant\\nonly if the air temperature reaches values higher than the optimumtemperature for photosynthesis. Therefore, paraheliotropism in S.\\ncamporum does not seem to be related to leaf heat avoidance.

Leaf gas exchange and light interception\\nS. camporum paraheliotropic leaves that intercepted light on\\nboth leaf sides displayed signiﬁcantly higher A,E,and gsthan dia-\\nheliotropic leaves during most times of the day ( Fig. 1 a, c and e).\\nThis high Afor paraheliotropic leaves could not be explained by\\nthe higher gsof para- compared to diaheliotropic leaves ( Fig. 1 c).\\nWhen leaves were illuminated on both leaf sides, it was clear thatAdid not depend on gs(Fig. 2 a). Separate groups of data demon-\\nstrate the greater response ranges for Aand gsin paraheliotropic\\ncompared to diaheliotropic leaves ( Fig. 2 a). For both leaf types, the\\nincreased stomatal aperture did not result in enhanced intercellu-lar CO\\n2(Fig. 3 a), the variation of which clearly did not affect the\\ncarbon assimilation rates ( Fig. 4 a). Furthermore, in nature, sunlight\\ninterception by the abaxial leaf side certainly does not explain thegreater gsfound in para- compared to diaheliotropic leaves ( Fig. 1 c),\\nbecause adaxial and abaxial sides of both leaf types when illumi-nated by the artiﬁcial red/blue light demonstrated the same valuesofgsat each PPFD of the gs/PPFD curves ( Fig. 5 b).\\nLeaves measured with light interception by only the adaxial\\nleaf surface showed signiﬁcantly higher Ain para- than in diahe-\\nliotropic leaves only at 11:00 h ( Fig. 1 b).

For Helianthus annus leaves, direct light reﬂectance was only\\nslightly higher in the abaxial compared to the adaxial leaf surface,but diffuse light reﬂectance was signiﬁcantly higher in the abax-ial compared to the adaxial side ( Gorton et al., 2010 ). The stellate\\npubescence, which covers the abaxial leaf surface and is absent onthe adaxial side of S. camporum leaves ( Habermann et al., 2008 )\\nis, then, responsible for this increased light reﬂectance. In fact, theeffective quantum yield of photosystem II ( /Phi1PSII) and the electron\\ntransport rate (ETR) for both leaf sides of one-year-old S. campo-\\nrum plants were similar between leaf types, but higher in adaxial\\ncompared to abaxial sides (data not shown).\\nHowever, when carbon assimilation was measured with light\\ninterception by only one of the leaf sides using the artiﬁcialred/blue light, which precisely emits the photosynthetic activewaveband, it seems that the vertical leaf position of S. campo-\\nrum enables increased light use efﬁciency. When PPFD varied from\\n200 to 1800 /H9262mol photons m\\n−2s−1, the adaxial sides of diahe-\\nliotropic leaves displayed maximum CO 2assimilation rates ( Amax\\nunder saturating light, but non-saturating CO 2, for photosynthesis\\nresponses) that were signiﬁcantly higher than those of their abaxialsides ( Fig. 5 a).

This\\nsuggests that increased light interception by the abaxial sides ofdiaheliotropic leaves does not improve their light use efﬁciency;therefore, some innate low Amax values are present for the abax-\\nial sides of diaheliotropic leaves. Adaxial surfaces of para- anddiaheliotropic leaves presented the same ( P< 0.05) Aas the PPFD\\nvaried from 200 to 1800 /H9262mol photons m\\n−2s−1(Fig. 5 a).

These results sup-\\nport the integration of the photosynthetic capacities of adaxial andabaxial leaf sides, which may have occurred in S. camporum (Fig. 1 a).\\nWe have not measured the apparent quantum yield, but when\\nleaves were illuminated on both surfaces, the photosynthetic radi-ation use efﬁciency (PhRUE) was higher in para- compared todiaheliotropic leaves throughout the day, and when the samerange of PPFD intercepted adaxial leaf surfaces only, para- and dia-heliotropic leaves showed similar PhRUE at 9:00 h, 14:00 h, and16:00 h (See online supplementary data for details; Table S1 ). Thus,\\nwe propose that the leaves of S. camporum photosynthetically ben-\\neﬁt from paraheliotropism, although there is no evidence that thisgreat PhRUE increases plant ecological performance, for instance,by increasing plant biomass.\\nThe vertical leaf position in S. camporum enables increased pho-\\ntosynthetic efﬁciency in terms of CO\\n2consumption, but not in\\nterms of light absorptance, especially when considering the contri-bution of the abaxial leaf surface, which is highly reﬂective. In fact,for some epiphytic fern leaves, the higher Avalues observed for\\nthe leaf side mostly exposed to direct sunlight was attributable toa greater CO\\n2consumption ( Martin et al., 2009 ). Notwithstanding,\\nthe reﬂectance pattern of the adaxial side is very similar to the abax-ial leaf side, with both sides exhibiting great reﬂectance within thegreen spectrum (525–575 nm) ( Fig. 8 ). This indicates that, although\\npubescence promotes light reﬂectance, the abaxial leaf surface cer-tainly absorbs a small amount of light within the red spectrum,which is greater in direct sunlight than in scattered light. For H.\\nannus leaves, there was almost the same direct light absorptance\\nbetween the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces, but when diffuselight absorptance was measured, the abaxial side showed a slightlylower value ( Gorton et al., 2010 ). Therefore, as supported by A/PPFD\\ncurves ( Fig. 5 a) abaxial leaf surfaces of S. camporum may not have\\nlight leaf absorptance signiﬁcantly decreased under elevated irra-diances. S. camporum leaves have compact spongy parenchyma and\\nampliﬁed palisade parenchyma (See online supplementary datafor details; Figs. S1d, e and f ), suggesting that these cells have\\nhigh chlorophyll content. Features such as stomata limited to theabaxial surface, developed palisade parenchyma, and compactlyarranged spongy parenchyma are constant in leaves of cerradowoody species ( Bieras and Sajo, 2009 ). Indeed, compact leaf tissues\\nhave previously been suggested to enable greater light interceptionand high water use efﬁciency ( Chaves et al., 2002 ).G. Habermann et al. / Environmental and Experimental Botany 71 (2011) 10–17 17\\nOne could still argue that different devices, rather than light\\ninterception, determined the differences in gas exchange, since nat-ural sunlight was used for double sided illumination measurementsand artiﬁcial red/blue light was used for single sided illuminationmeasurements. However, regardless of the device/system used,the range of PPFD values reaching leaf surfaces was very similar.Moreover, results of A,gs, and Ciobtained from PPFD curves indi-\\ncated that there are distinct responses in para- and diaheliotropicleaves when considering each leaf surface under saturating andnon-saturating red/blue light ( Fig. 5 ).\\nFinally, it is essential to emphasize that it was not the leaf age,\\nrather than the leaf position, that determined our observations.Paraheliotropic leaves that were assessed were distinguishablefrom diaheliotropic leaves. These paraheliotropic leaves hadmature fully expanded blades, and they were localized on woodystems and primary branches of adult plants. Additionally, for somestems, paraheliotropic and diaheliotropic leaves were adjacent toeach other (See online supplementary data for details; Fig. S1a ).\\n4.4. Ecophysiological signiﬁcance of heliotropism for S.\\ncamporum\\nIt has been accepted that paraheliotropism is a mechanism\\nfor reducing transpiration rates, irradiance interception, conse-quently minimizing leaf heat and the potential for photoinhibition(Ehleringer and Forseth, 1980; Forseth and Ehleringer, 1982;\\nForseth and Teramura, 1986; Bielenberg et al., 2003; Pastenes et al.,2005; Liu et al., 2007; Arena et al., 2008 ), although paraheliotropism\\nmay also prevent optimum CO\\n2assimilation rates ( Pastenes et al.,\\n2005 ). These traditional explanations for the signiﬁcance of leaf\\nheliotropism have been based on leguminous species, including P.\\npubescens from the cerrado ( Caldas et al., 1997 ).\\nNonetheless, our data strongly suggest that, although the abax-\\nial leaf surface is highly reﬂective, it may absorb a small amountof natural direct light within the red spectrum, which photosyn-thetically increases the efﬁciency of paraheliotropic leaves in termsof CO\\n2consumption, because adaxial and abaxial leaf sides seem\\nto integrate their respective carbon assimilation rates. However,these observations are detected only if measured with devices thatenable light interception by both leaf surfaces. Moreover, parahe-liotropism in S. camporum does not seem to be related to leaf heat\\navoidance ( Fig. 6 ), neither does it minimize the potential for pho-\\ntoinhibition (data not shown). Therefore, in contrast to the resultsfor leguminous species, the paraheliotropism of only some leavesofS. camporum , which do not even show pulvinus in their petioles\\n(Machado, 1991 ), could have novel signiﬁcance for plant ecophys-\\niology.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank Dr. Luis Alberti for Photoshop assistance; Fundac ¸ã o\\nde Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (Fapesp) for fel-lowships to Patricia F.

In  addition  to  resource  limitations,\\nplant  communities  have  to  deal  with  anthropogenic  stressors  such\\nas  acid  rain,  or  organic  and  inorganic  pollutants  like  pesticides  or\\nheavy  metals.  Indeed,  metal  toxicity  limits  plant  growth  in  many\\nareas  affected  by  mining  or  smelting  activities,  sewage  sludge  depo-\\nsition  or  trafﬁc  (Kabata-Pendias  and  Pendias,  2001;  Arienzo  et  al.,\\n2004 ).\\nPredicting  future  plant  responses  to  the  ongoing  increase  in\\nfrequency  and  intensity  of  droughts  (IPCC,  2007 )  requires  a  mech-\\nanistic  understanding  of  how  plants  cope  with  drought  stress\\nunder  conditions  of  elevated  atmospheric  CO 2concentrations  and\\nwarmer  temperatures.  Besides  climate  related  stressors,  this  also\\nholds  for  future  responses  to  natural  stressors  like  nutrient  limita-\\ntion  or  anthropogenic  stressors  like  heavy  metal  pollution,  which  is\\nwhy  multifactorial  experiments  are  often  called  for  (Norby  and  Luo,\\n2004;  Mittler,  2006 ).  Nonetheless,  ﬁeld  studies  of  stress  responses\\nunder  combined  elevated  CO 2and  warming  remain  very  scarce\\n(Casella  et  al.,  1996;  Dukes  et  al.,  2005;  Mikkelsen  et  al.,  2008;  Bloor\\net  al.,  2010 ).\\nSingle  factor  studies,  on  the  other  hand,  have  been  fre-\\nquently  reported,  especially  the  effects  of  elevated  CO 2.

All  other  effects  of  elevated  CO 2on  plants  and  ecosys-\\ntems  are  derived  from  these  changes  (Long  et  al.,  2004 ).  Also  the\\neffect  of  single  warming  or  elevated  CO 2on  one  environmental\\nstressor  has  been  reported  in  the  literature.  For  example,  elevated\\nCO 2can  moderate  water  shortages  during  drought  through  its\\neffect  on  stomatal  conductance  (Rogers  et  al.,  1984 ),  while  warming\\ncan  cause  reduced  water  availability  due  to  increased  evapotrans-\\npiration  (Loik  et  al.,  2000 ).  Future  climate  conditions  may  also  affect\\nthe  availability  of  N.  Increased  carbon  (C)  input  under  elevated  CO 2\\nis  found  to  decrease  soil  N  availability  through  enhanced  micro-\\nbial  immobilization  (Luo  et  al.,  2004;  Hu  et  al.,  2006 ),  eventually\\nleading  to  N  limitation  (Oren  et  al.,  2001;  Hungate  et  al.,  2003;  Luo\\net  al.,  2004 ).  However,  increasing  soil  temperatures  could  reverse\\nthis  reduction  in  N  availability,  by  enhancing  net  N  mineralization\\n(Loiseau  and  Soussana,  2000;  Hovenden  et  al.,  2008 ).  Enhanced\\nmineralization  could also alter  heavy  metal  availability  if  the  metals\\nare  bound  to  soil  organic  matter  (Antoniadis  and  Alloway,  2001 ).\\nHence, it is  clear  that  a  future  climate  can  change  the  intensity\\nof  stress  factors  by  decreasing  or  increasing  the  availabilities  of\\nresources and/or pollutants.\\nRegardless  of  a  possible  impact  on  the  intensity  of  a  stressor,\\na changing climate  could  also  affect  the  plant’s  protective  capac-\\nity  and,  as  a  consequence,  their  growth  responses  to  stress.  As  a\\nresult  of  stress-induced  perturbations  in  plant  metabolism,  lev-\\nels  of  reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS)  generally  increase  (Mittler,\\n2002 ).  The  production  of  ROS  during  stress  results  from  imbalances\\nin  pathways  such  as  photorespiration,  from  the  photosynthetic\\napparatus  and  from  mitochondrial  respiration.  In  addition,  envi-\\nronmental  stress  has  been  shown  to  trigger  the  active  production\\nof  ROS  by  NADPH  oxidases  (Knight  and  Knight,  2001 ).  Reactive  oxy-\\ngen  species  can  act  as  signals  for  the  activation  of  stress  response\\nand  defence  pathways,  but  they  can  also  be  harmful  for  biological\\nstructures  and  processes,  and  can  lead  to  DNA,  amino  acid  and  pro-\\ntein  oxidation  and  lipid  peroxidation  (Asada,  1999 ).  To  circumvent\\nthe  deleterious  effects  of  ROS,  plants  have  evolved  robust  antioxi-\\ndant  defensive  systems  to  minimize  free  radicals  damage  (Mittler\\net  al.,  2004 ).  Interestingly,  oxidative  stress  and  antioxidant  systems\\nmay be  altered  in  a  future  climate.  Yet,  the  effect  of  combined  ele-\\nvated  CO 2and  warming  on  stress-relief  mechanisms  has  received\\nlittle  attention  (Aranjuelo  et  al.,  2008 ).  Single  elevated  CO 2can\\ndiminish  intrinsic  oxidative  stress  through  decreased  ROS  forma-\\ntion,  resulting  from  an  enhanced  use  of  reductant  for  assimilation\\nin  photosynthesis  and  a  reduced  photorespiration  (Halliwell  and\\nGutteridge,  1989;  Schwanz  and  Polle,  1998 ).  Consequently,  a  down-\\nregulation  of  the  protective  mechanisms  by  elevated  CO 2has  been\\nreported  in  several  studies  (Schwanz  and  Polle,  1998;  Vurro  et  al.,\\n2009 ).  Another  observed  effect  of  elevated  CO 2occurs  prior  to  any\\nphotooxidative  process  and  operates  through  an  enhanced  thermal\\ndissipation  of  excessive  energy  (nonphotochemical  quenching),\\nresulting  in  an  improved  photoprotection  (Aranjuelo  et  al.,  2008 ).\\nFurthermore,  also  moderate  warming  can  contribute  to  alleviating\\noxidative  stress  through  an  enhancement  of  metabolic  reactions\\n(Han  et  al.,  2009 ).\\nGrasslands  cover  15%  of  the  European  land  area  and  are\\nan  important  food  source  for  livestock  (Ciais  et  al.,  2010 ).  An\\nunderstanding  of  potential  stress-induced  reductions  in  biomass\\nproduction  is  thus  relevant,  both  now  and  under  changing  cli-\\nmate  conditions.  In  the  present  study  we  have  determined  how\\ngrassland  communities  respond  to  a  variety  of  stressors  in  a  future\\nclimate  at  both  the  cellular  and  the  community  level.  Hence,  this\\nstudy  responds  to  the  need  for  research  that  relates  molecular\\ninformation  to  whole  plant  processes  (Chaves  et  al.,  2003 ).  The\\nexperimental set-up  contained  realistically  assembled  grassland\\ncommunities  that  were  grown  under  a  current  and  a  projectedfuture  climate,  and  subjected  to  drought,  N  limitation,  Zn  toxicity\\nand  their  combinations.  We  hypothesize  that  combined  elevated\\nCO 2and  warming  ameliorates  plant  protection  against  stress  and\\nthat  this  increased  protection  mitigates  the  decline  in  grassland\\nproductivity  in  response  to  stress.\\n2.  Materials  and  methods\\n2.1.  Experimental  set-up\\nThe  study  was  performed  on  assembled  grassland  communities\\nat  the  Drie  Eiken  Campus,  University  of  Antwerp,  Wilrijk,  Belgium\\n(51◦09/primeN,  04◦24/primeE,  10  asl).  Average  annual  precipitation  at  this\\nlocation  is  776  mm,  average  annual  air  temperature  is  around\\n10.8◦C.  The  experimental  set-up  consisted  of  six  sunlit,  south\\nfacing  climate-controlled  chambers.  The  interior  surface  area  was\\n1.5 m  ×  1.5  m,  the  height  at  the  north  side  1.5  m  and  at  the  south\\nside  1.2 m. The top  of  the  chambers  consisted  of  a  colourless\\npolycarbonate plate  (4  mm  thick),  whereas  the  sides  were  made  of\\npolyethylene  ﬁlm (200 /H9262m  thick),  both  UV  transparent.  Three  of  the\\nsix  chambers  tracked  the  current  climate  with  current  air  temper-\\nature  (Tair)  and  CO 2concentration,  while  the  other  three  chambers\\nwere  exposed  to  a  future  climate  scenario  with  3◦C  warming  and  a\\ntarget  CO 2concentration  of  620.  We  further  refer  to  these  climate\\nscenarios  as  ‘current’  and  ‘future  climate’,  respectively,  although  it\\nis  recognized  that  future  climate  conditions  as  predicted  by  the  IPCC\\nalso  include  other  aspects  such  as  changes  in  precipitation  and  wind\\npatterns,  more  frequent  extreme  events  and  increased  emissions\\nof  aerosols,  methane  and  nitrous  oxide  (IPCC,  2007 ).  The  CO 2con-\\ncentration  was  measured  and  regulated  with  a  CO 2control  group\\nwith  an  infrared  analyser  (WMA-4,  PPSystems,  Hitchin,  UK).  In  the\\ncurrent  climate  chambers  the  concentration  was  394  ±  34  ppm\\n(SD)  while  in  the  future  climate  chambers  it  was  625  ±  53  ppm\\n(SD).  Every  half  hour,  Tair was  monitored  with  a  temperature\\nsensor  (Siemens,  type  QFA66,  Germany)  and  photosynthetically\\nactive  radiation  was  measured  with  a  quantum  sensor  (SDEC,  type\\nJYP1000,  France).  During  the  experiment  monthly  average  Tairwas\\n17.1,  16.4  and  18.4◦C  in  May,  June  and  July  2008,  respectively.\\nIn  the  current  climate  chambers  Tairwas  on  average  0.6  ±  1.6◦C\\n(SD)  lower  than  outside  and  the  future  climate  chambers  were\\n2.5  ±  1.6◦C  (SD)  warmer  than  outside.  Total  monthly  irrigation\\nequalled  61.5,  64.4  and  85.1  mm  in  May,  June  and  July,  respectively.\\nIrrigation  was  calculated  from  the  monthly  rainfall  over  the  period\\n1995–2005  and  corrected  for  differences  in  evapotranspiration\\n(ET)  inside  and  outside  the  chambers.  To  this  end,  De  Boeck  et  al.\\n(2006)  calculated  ET  inside  current  climate  chambers  from  changes\\nin  soil  water  content  (SWC)  and  the  amount  of  administered  water,\\nand  the  outside  ET  with  Hamon’s  equation  (Haith  and  Shoemaker,\\n1987 )  based  on  day  length,  vapour  pressure  and  Tair.\\n2.2.  Plant  communities\\nThis  study  was  part  of  a  larger  experiment  that  consisted  of  30\\nrandomly  placed  grassland  communities  per  chamber.  Each  com-\\nmunity  was  composed  of  six  species,  selected  from  three  functional\\ngroups  which  were  equally  represented:  two  grass  species  (Poa\\npratensis  L.  and  Lolium  perenne  L.),  two  N-ﬁxing  dicots  (Medicago\\nlupulina  L.  and  Lotus  corniculatus  L.),  and  two  non-N-ﬁxing  dicots\\n(Rumex  acetosa  L.  and  Plantago  lanceolata  L.).  The  communities  con-\\ntained  18  individuals  (three  per  species)  planted  in  a  hexagonal\\ngrid  with  a  4.5  cm  interspace,  with  interspeciﬁc  interactions  maxi-\\nmized  by  avoiding  clumping.  Communities  were  established  early\\nMay  2008  (day  of  year  (DOY)  134–137)  by  transplanting  5-week-\\nold seedlings  to  PVC  containers  (tubes,  24  cm  inner  diameter  and\\n40  cm  height,  closed  with  a  lid  at  the  bottom)  ﬁlled  with  sandy  soil152  K.

Imposed  stressors\\nFor  the  present  study,  a  subset  of  8  communities  per  chamber\\nwas  used.  In  each  chamber  one  community  was  given  no  stress  (U:\\n“unstressed”)  and  seven  communities  were  subjected  to  drought\\nstress  (D),  nitrogen  limitation  (N),  zinc  toxicity  (Z)  or  a  combination\\nof  these  stressors  (DN,  DZ,  NZ  or  DNZ).  Drought  stress  was  applied\\nby  withholding  water  for  a  period  of  14  days  in  the  ﬁrst  half  of  July\\n2008  (DOY  182–196).  Soil  water  content  was  measured  with  a  PR2\\nsoil  moisture  sensor  (Delta-T  Devices  Ltd.,  UK)  two  times  a  week\\nduring  the  drought  treatment  and  once  a  week  throughout  the  rest\\nof the  experiment.\\nThe  communities  were  fertilized  with  15  g  N  m−2NH 4NO 3,\\n7.5  g  m−2P2O5,  15  g  m−2K2O  and  micro-elements  (Fe,  Mn,  Zn,  Cu,  B,\\nMo),  with  the  exception  of  the  communities  that  were  subjected  to\\nN  limitation.  These  received  all  nutrients  in  the  same  dose  except\\nfor  nitrogen.  All  nutrients  were  given  dissolved  in  water,  half  on\\nDOY  146  and  the  other  half  on  DOY  171.  Nitrogen  concentrations\\nwere  measured  with  a  CN  element  analyser  (NC-2100,  Carlo  Erba\\nInstruments,  Milan,  Italy)  after  grinding  the  samples.  Total  com-\\nmunity  N  stock  (above-ground  +  roots)  was  determined  on  each\\ncommunity  by  multiplying  N  concentrations  with  biomass,  sep-\\narately  for  the  above-ground  and  the  root  compartment.\\nZinc  was  mixed  with  the  soil  40  days  before  the  seedlings  were\\ntransplanted  to  the  containers,  so  that  the  soil  could  stabilize.  Per\\ncontainer  280  ml  of  a  50  g  Zn  L−1ZnCl 2solution  was  administered.\\nConcentrations  of  Zn  in  roots  and  shoots  were  measured  after  diges-\\ntion  by  warming  with  HNO 3and  H2O2,  using  mass  spectrometry\\n(ICP-MS,  Finnigan  Element  XR,  Scientiﬁc,  Bremen,  Germany).\\n2.4. Biomass  harvest\\nAbove-ground  (shoot  –  above  3.5  cm  –  and  stubble)  and  root\\nbiomass  were  harvested  immediately  after  the  imposed  drought\\nperiod (DOY  196–200).  Above-ground  biomass  was  subdivided\\nby  species.  In  each  chamber  one  community  was  harvested  per\\ntreatment,  yielding  three  replicates  (chambers)  per  climate.  Per\\nspecies  a  subsample  was  taken  from  the  shoot  biomass  and  its  fresh\\nweight  was  determined.  The  remaining  shoot  was  weighed  fresh\\nand  immediately  frozen  in  liquid  nitrogen  (see  further).  The  total\\nshoot  dry  weight  per  species  was  calculated  from  the  total  shoot\\nfresh  weight  and  the  dry  weight/fresh  weight  ratio  of  the  subsam-\\nple.  Dry  weights  were  determined  after  drying  the  biomass  for  48  h\\nat  70◦C.  The  shoot  dry  weight  of  the  community  was  calculated\\nas  the  sum  of  the  shoot  dry  weights  of  the  six  composing  species.\\nRoot  biomass  was  estimated  from  12  soil  cores  (2  cm  diameter)  per\\ncommunity.  To  adequately  represent  the  total  root  biomass  in  the\\nsoil,  six  cores  were  taken  directly  below  the  plants  (one  per  species)\\nand  six  cores  in  the  middle  of  a  triangle  between  three  plant  pos-\\nitions.  Root  samples  were  washed  until  they  were  free  of  soil.  Total\\nbiomass  included  the  sum  of  above-ground  and  root  biomass.\\n2.5. Biochemical parameters\\nTo  detect  the  underlying  metabolic  processes  that  determine\\nthe  effect  of  climate  on  the  stress  response  of  the  communities,\\nwe  analyzed  several  biochemical  parameters:  insoluble  sugar  (IS)\\nconcentrations, lipid  peroxidation,  total  antioxidant  capacity  (TAC),polyphenol  concentrations,  tocopherol  concentrations  and,  ascor-\\nbate  (ASC)  and  glutathione  (GSH)  concentrations  and  redox  status.\\n2.5.1. Insoluble  sugar  concentration\\nInsoluble sugar  (IS)  concentrations  were  determined  according\\nto  Leyva  et  al.  (2008) .  Fifty  mg  frozen  shoot  tissue  was  homogenized\\nin 2  ml  of  pure  acetone  to  extract  and  remove  interfering  pigments\\nand  soluble  sugars,  centrifuged  at  9.5  g  for  20  min,  and  the  super-\\nnatant  decanted.  Insoluble  sugars  were  extracted  by  adding  1.1%\\nHCl  to  the  residues,  heating  for  30  min  at  100◦C,  cooling  and  cen-\\ntrifugation  (9.5  g,  20  min).  The  supernatant  was  diluted  with  water\\nto  5  ml.  Freshly  prepared  anthrone  reagent  (150  /H9262l)  was  combined\\nwith  50  /H9262l  of  the  sample  dilutions  in  a  microplate,  and  absorbance\\nwas  measured  at  620  nm  (Multiskan  RC  plate  reader  type  351,  Lab-\\nsystems,  Colorado,  USA).  Glucose  was  used  for  the  standard  curve.\\n2.5.2. Lipid  peroxidation\\nLipid peroxidation  was  determined  using  the  thiobarbituric\\nacid–malondialdehyde  (TBA–MDA)  assay  (Hodges  et  al.,  1999 ).  Five\\nhundred  microliter  of  plant  shoot  extract  (see  above)  was  combined\\nwith  500  /H9262l  of  MDA  reagent  [20%  (w/v)  trichloroacetic  acid,  0.01%\\n(w/v)  butylated  hydroxytoluene],  with  or  without  0.65%  (w/v)  TBA.\\nThe  samples  were  mixed,  incubated  at  95◦C  for  30  min,  cooled\\nand  re-centrifuged.  Absorbance  was  measured  (Milton  Roy  Spec-\\ntronic  301,  New  York,  USA)  at  440  nm,  532  nm  and  600  nm.  MDA\\nequivalents  were  calculated  as  described  by  Hodges  et  al.  (1999) .\\n2.5.3. Total  antioxidant  capacity\\nA modiﬁed ferric  ion  reducing  antioxidant  power  (FRAP)  assay\\nwas  used  to  estimate  the  total  antioxidant  capacity  (TAC)  of\\nplant  extracts  (Benzie  and  Strain,  1996 ).  Two  hundred  mg  of\\nfrozen  shoot  tissue  was  extracted  in  2  ml  of  80%  (v/v)  ethanol\\nusing  by  mortar  and  pestle,  followed  by  centrifugation  (3000  ×  g\\nfor  15  min,  4◦C).  The  samples  were  then  mixed  with  the  FRAP\\nreagent,  and  the  absorption  was  measured  at  600  nm  after  3  and\\n20  min  (Multiskan  RC  plate  reader  type  351).  6-Hydroxy-2,5,7,8-\\ntetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic  acid  (Trolox)  was  used  as  the\\nstandard.\\n2.5.4.  Polyphenol  concentration\\nThe concentration  of  polyphenols  in  the  80%  (v/v)  ethanol\\nplant  extracts  was  determined  spectrophotometrically  using  the\\nFolin–Ciocalteu reagent,  following  the  method  of  Galvez  et  al.\\n(2005) .  Brieﬂy,  100  /H9262l  of  extract  were  diluted  with  2  ml  water,\\n200  /H9262l  Folin–Ciocalteu  phenol  reagent,  and  1  ml  of  15%  (w/v)\\nNa 2CO 3,  mixed  and  allowed  to  stand  for  2  h.  The  absorbance  was\\nmeasured  at  765  nm  (Milton  Roy  Spectronic  301).  Gallic  acid  was\\nused  to  make  a  standard  curve  and  the  polyphenol  concentration\\nis  expressed  as  mg  ml−1gallic  acid  equivalents  (GAE).\\n2.5.5.  Tocopherol  concentration\\nTocopherols were  extracted  with  hexane  from  fresh  shoot  mate-\\nrial  (MagNA  Lyser,  Roche,  Vilvoorde,  Belgium,  1  min,  7000  rpm).\\nThe  dried  extract  (CentriVap  concentrator,  Labconco,  Kansas,  USA)\\nwas  resuspended  in  100  /H9262l  hexane,  and  tocopherols  were  sepa-\\nrated  by  HPLC  (HPLC  system,  Shimadzu,  ‘s  Hertogenbosch,  The\\nNetherlands)  (normal  phase  conditions,  Particil  Pac  5  /H9262m  colum\\nmaterial,  length  250  mm,  i.d.  4.6  mm).  Elution  was  isocratic  with\\n8%  tetrahydrofuran  in  hexane  (column  temperature  at  40◦C).  A  ﬂu-\\norescence  detector  (RF-10A,  Shimadzu,  ex  =  295  nm,  em  =  330  nm)\\nand  a  diode  array  detector  (SPD-M10AVP,  Shimadzu)  were  used\\nin  line,  for  optimal  sensitivity  and  to  check  peak  purity.  Dimethyl\\ntocol  (DMT)  (Matreya  LLC,  Pennsylvania,  USA)  was  used  as  inter-\\nnal  standard  (5  ppm).  Data  were  analyzed  with  Shimadzu  Class  VP\\nsoftware  6.14.K.

Ascorbate  and  (homo)glutathione  concentration  and  redox\\nstatus\\nAscorbate (ASC),  glutathione  (GSH)  and  homoglutathione\\n(hGSH)  levels  were  determined  by  HPLC  analysis  (Shimadzu)\\n(Potters  et  al.,  2002 ).  Two  hundred  mg  of  frozen  tissue  were\\nextracted  with  a  mortar  and  pestle  with  1  ml  of  ice-cold  6%\\n(w/v) meta-phosphoric  acid.  After  centrifugation  (16,000  ×  g,  4◦C,\\n10  min),  antioxidants  were  separated  on  a  reversed  phase  column\\n(100  ×  4.6  mm  Polaris  C18-A,  3  /H9262m  particle  size;  40◦C;  Varian,  CA,\\nUSA)  with  an  isocratic  ﬂow  rate  of  1  ml  min−1of  the  elution  buffer\\n(2  mM  KCl,  pH  2.5  adjusted  with  o-phosphoric  acid).  The  com-\\nponents  were  quantiﬁed  using  a  custom-made  electrochemical\\ndetector  with  a  glassy  carbon  electrode  and  a  Schott  Pt  62  reference\\nelectrode  (Mainz,  Germany).  The  purity  and  identity  of  the  peaks\\nwere  conﬁrmed  using  a  diode  array  detector  (SPD-M10AVP,  Shi-\\nmadzu),  in  line  with  the  electrochemical  detector.  Chromatogram\\nanalysis was  performed  using  the  Shimadzu  Class  VP  software  6.14.\\nTotal  antioxidant  concentrations  (reduced  +  oxidized)  were  deter-\\nmined  after  reducing  100  /H9262l  sample  with  DTT  (50  /H9262l,  200  mM  DTT\\nin  400  mM  Tris),  for  10  min  at  room  temperature  and  protected\\nfrom light.  The  redox  statuses  were  determined  by  dividing  the\\nreduced  form  of  the  antioxidant  by  the  total  concentration.  In  the\\nN-ﬁxing  species  (M.  lupulina ,  L.  corniculatus ),  GSH  is  largely  replaced\\nby  hGSH,  and  we  used  the  added  concentrations  (hGSH  +  GSH).\\n2.6. Calculations  and  statistical  analysis\\nAll data  are  analyzed  at  community  level  rather  than  at  species\\nlevel  since  analyses  of  the  species  responses  would  ignore  the  rel-\\native  share  of  each  species  in  the  community.  Furthermore,  this\\napproach  is  more  relevant  when  predicting  agricultural  produc-\\ntivity  losses  or  stress  impacts  on  the  C  cycle.  To  determine  the\\ncontribution  of  each  species  to  the  overall  community  for  the  bio-\\nchemical  parameters,  individual  species  values  were  multiplied\\nwith  the  corresponding  dry  weight  biomass  proportion  of  the\\nspecies  in  the  community.  Biochemical  parameters  are  expressed\\non  a  fresh  weight  basis.\\nTo  allow  separation  of  a  climate  effect  on  the  response  to  stress\\nfrom  a  climate  effect  on  the  unstressed  communities,  we  calculated\\nthe stress  responses  (impact)  for  each  climate.  We  therefore  sub-\\ntracted  the  values  of  the  unstressed  communities  from  the  values\\nof  the  stressed  communities  of  the  corresponding  climate  (further\\nreferred  to  as  ‘stress  impact’).  The  analysis  of  both  the  absolute  val-\\nues  of  the  stressed  communities  and  the  stress  impact,  indirectly\\ngave  us  information  on  the  climate  effect  in  unstressed  communi-\\nties.  For  example,  if  there  was  a  signiﬁcant  effect  of  climate  on  the\\nabsolute  values  of  the  stressed  communities,  and  no  effect  on  stress\\nimpact,  we  concluded  that  the  observed  climate  effect  was  present\\nin  the  unstressed  communities  as  well,  as  they  served  as  the  refer-\\nence  to  calculate  the  stress  impact.  To  visualize  the  stress  impact\\nresults,  the  stress  impact  in  future  climate  was  plotted  against  the\\nstress  impact  in  current  climate  for  all  different  parameters  (see  for\\nexample  Fig.  1a).  The  1:1  line  in  these  graphs  represents  a  stress\\nimpact  that  is  not  altered  by  climate;  values  above  the  1:1  line  rep-\\nresent  an  increased  positive  or  a  reduced  negative  impact  of  stress\\nin  future  climate;  values  below  the  1:1  line  represent  a  reduced\\npositive  or  an  increased  negative  impact  of  stress  in  future  climate.\\nHence,  per  parameter  two  statistical  analyses  were  performed:\\none  on  the  absolute  values  of  the  parameter  in  the  stressed  com-\\nmunities  and  a  second  on  the  stress  impact  values.  ANOVA’s  were\\nperformed  in  SAS  9.1  (SAS  Institute  Inc.,  Cary,  NC,  USA)  using  the\\nmixed  procedure  (Littell  et  al.,  1996 )  with  climate  and  stress  (=  all\\nstressors  and  their  combinations)  as  ﬁxed  factors,  and  chamber  as  a\\nrandom  factor  nested  within  climate.  Effects  were  considered  sig-\\nniﬁcant at  P  <  0.05.  Non-signiﬁcant  terms  were  excluded  from  the\\nmodel.  We  did  not  perform  a  multifactorial  analysis  with  the  threestressors  as  ﬁxed  factors  because  the  scope  of  this  paper  is  to  study\\nthe  effect  of  climate  on  stress  impact  rather  than  the  interactions\\nbetween  stressors.  Combining  the  stressors  and  their  combinations\\nin  one  ﬁxed  factor  increased  the  statistical  power  to  detect  an  effect\\nof  climate  on  the  stress  impact.\\n3.  Results\\n3.1.  Intensity  of  the  stressors\\nApplication  of  stressors  effectively  deteriorated  growth  condi-\\ntions  for  the  plant  communities.  Nitrogen  limited  communities  (N,\\nNZ,  DN,  DNZ)  had  a  lower  total  N  stock  than  unstressed  communi-\\nties  (F4,22 =  12.58,  P  <  0.001;  a  posteriori  comparison  of  unstressed\\nwith  stressed  communities,  P  <  0.05  in  all  cases;  Figure  S1).  Zn  con-\\ncentrations  were  higher  in  communities  with  added  Zn  (Z,  NZ,  DZ,\\nDNZ)  than  in  unstressed  communities,  for  shoots  as  well  as  for\\nroots  (F4,24 =  5.61,  P  =  0.025  and  F4,24 =  14.09,  P  <  0.001,  a  posteriori\\ncomparison  of  unstressed  with  stressed  communities,  P  <  0.05  in  all\\ncases;  Figure  S2).  Logically,  SWC  decreased  in  the  drought  stressed\\ncommunities  (D,  DN,  DZ,  DNZ)  after  withholding  water  (DOY  182,\\nFigure  S3).\\nThe  N  stock  of  the  communities  did  not  differ  among  the\\nclimates  for  the  unstressed  nor  for  the  N  limited  communities\\n(F1,4=  0.01,  P  =  0.941  and  F1,17 =  3.41,  P  =  0.082,  respectively;  Fig-\\nure  S1).  Likewise,  the  shoot  and  root  Zn  concentrations  did  not\\ndiffer  among  the  climates  in  both  the  unstressed  and  the  Zn-\\npolluted  communities  (shoots:  F1,4=  0.01,  P  =  0.948  and  F1,22 =  0.02,\\nP  =  0.895;  roots:  F1,4=  0.13,  P  =  0.735  and  F1,22 =  1.14,  P  =  0.297,\\nrespectively;  Figure  S2).  In  contrast,  SWC  in  both  the  unstressed\\nand  stressed  communities  did  differ  among  the  climates  (F1,4=  7.88,\\nP  =  0.048  and  F1,4=  34.26,  P  =  0.0043,  respectively;  Figure  S3).  On\\naverage  drought  stressed  communities  (D,  DN,  DZ,  DNZ)  reached\\nwilting  point  at  DOY  189  and  186  in  current  and  future  climate,\\nrespectively  (Figure  S3).\\n3.2.  Plant  community  biomass\\nThe  above-ground  biomass  of  the  stressed  communities  was\\nconsistently  higher  in  the  future  than  in  the  current  climate,  inde-\\npendent  of  the  stress  treatment  (Fig.  1a,  Table  1).  The  stress  impact\\nplot for  above-ground  biomass  (Fig.  1b)  shows  all  observations\\nabove  the  1:1  line  and  in  the  lower  left  quadrant  (negative  val-\\nues),  demonstrating  a  smaller  stress-induced  decrease  of  biomass\\nproduction  in  the  future  climate  (Table  1).  This  observation  indi-\\ncates  a  mitigated  impact  of  a  variety  of  stressors  on  above-ground\\nbiomass  in  the  future  relative  to  the  current  climate.  In  contrast  to\\nabove-ground  biomass,  roots  responded  differently  to  climate  and\\nstress  (Figure  S4  and  Section  S5).  To  help  unravel  the  molecular\\nbasis  for  the  mitigated  stress  impact  on  above-ground  biomass  in\\nfuture  climate,  we  investigated  changes  in  the  sugar  content  and  in\\nplant  oxidative  stress  responses.\\n3.3. Insoluble sugar  concentration  and  lipid  peroxidation\\nThe insoluble sugar  concentration  reﬂects  the  levels  of  struc-\\ntural  carbohydrates  and  starch,  and  is  an  indicator  of  sugar  storage\\nand  cell  wall  formation  activities.  The  IS  levels  of  the  stressed  com-\\nmunities  did  not  differ  among  the  climates  (Fig.  2a,  Table  1).  The\\nstress  impact  on  IS,  on  the  other  hand,  was  smaller  in  future  (near\\nzero)  than  in  current  climate  conditions  (positive  values)  (Fig.  2b;\\nbelow  1:1  line,  Table  1).  Hence,  relative  to  unstressed  plants,  plants\\nunder  stress  allocated  less  C  towards  IS  in  the  future  than  in  the\\ncurrent  climate.\\nMalondialdehyde (MDA)  levels  are  commonly  used  as  an  indi-\\ncator  of  ROS-induced  membrane  damage.

Hence,  stress-induced\\ndamage  to  cell  membranes  was  probably  limited,  and  did  not  differ\\namong  the  climates,  neither  in  unstressed  nor  in  stressed  commu-\\nnities.\\n3.4.  Changes  in  antioxidant  metabolism\\nOne of the  most  common  defence  responses  of  plants  against\\noxidative  stress  involves  changes  in  ROS  scavenging  antioxidant\\nmetabolites.  The  overall  TAC  was  higher  in  the  future  than  in\\nthe  current  climate  for  stressed  communities,  whereas  the  stress\\nimpact  was  not  affected  by  climate  (Fig.  2e  and  f;  scattered  around\\nthe  1:1  line,  Table  1).  From  this  we  conclude  that  the  future  climate\\nled  to  an  up-regulation  of  small  molecular  weight  antioxidants,\\nwhich  contributes  to  the  TAC  in  both  unstressed  and  stressed  con-\\nditions.\\nThe TAC  of  plant  tissues  is  determined  by  a  large  variety  of\\nantioxidant  molecules,  including  polyphenols,  tocopherols,  ASC\\nand  GSH.  We  measured  changes  in  the  levels  of  each  of  these\\ngroups  of  metabolites.  The  polyphenol  levels  followed  the  same\\npattern as  for  the  TAC;  i.e.  in  the  future  climate  an  up-regulation\\nin  both  stressed  and  unstressed  conditions  was  observed  (Table  1,Fig. 2g  and  h).  The  ﬁnding  that  polyphenol  levels  correlated  with\\nthe  TAC  suggests  that  the  TAC,  for  the  largest  part,  was  deter-\\nmined  by  polyphenolic  constituents.  The  levels  of  /H9251-tocopherol,\\na  membrane-embedded  lipophilic  antioxidant,  were  not  altered  by\\nclimate  neither  for  the  absolute  nor  for  the  stress  impact  values\\n(Table  1,  Figure  S6a  and  b).  This  result  is  consistent  with  the  lipid\\nperoxidation  data,  supporting  the  idea  of  limited  cell  membrane\\ndamage  and,  consequently,  minimal  changes  in  the  biosynthesis  of\\nlipophilic-antioxidant  compounds.\\nAscorbate  and  glutathione  are  two  essential  plant  molecu-\\nlar  antioxidants  interconnected  in  the  so-called  ASC-GSH  cycle\\n(Mittler  et  al.,  2004 ).  Both  the  absolute  levels  and  the  redox  status  of\\nthese molecules  are  considered  important  oxidative  stress  param-\\neters.  Absolute  ASC  levels  and  ASC  redox  status  of  the  stressed\\ncommunities  did  not  differ  between  the  climates.

However,  the  GSH  redox  status  was  not  affected  by  climate\\nneither  in  absolute  nor  in  stress  impact  values  (Figure  S6e  and  f;\\nscattered  around  the  1:1  line,  Table  1).  This  indicated  that  there\\nwere  no  stress-induced  changes  in  the  GSH  redox  status  in  plants\\ngrown  under  either  climate  conditions.\\n4.  Discussion\\nThe  present  study  unambiguously  demonstrates  that,  across\\nthree  different  abiotic  stressors,  above-ground  biomass  production\\nof  grassland  communities  was  reduced  less  by  stress  in  a  future  than\\nin  a  current  climate.  Despite  some  recent  efforts  (Aranjuelo  et  al.,\\n2006;  Bloor  et  al.,  2010;  Kongstad  et  al.,  2012 ),  very  few  studies\\nhave  focused  on  the  interactions  between  stress  impact  and  climate\\nchange.  For  N  limitation,  similar  results  were  found  in  an  earlier\\nmanipulation  experiment  on  identical  grassland  communities  in\\nwhich  N  limitation  decreased  biomass  production  under  a  current\\nclimate,  but  not  under  a  future  climate  (Van  den  Berge  et  al.,  2011b ).\\nHowever,  in  the  same  experimental  set-up  drought  impact  was  not\\naltered  by  a  future  climate  (Naudts  et  al.,  2011,  2013 ).  A  similarobservation  has  been  reported  for  Lotus  corniculatus  L.  monocul-\\ntures grown under  laboratory  conditions  at  a  constant  temperature\\n(Carter  et  al.,  1997 ).\\nWhat  mechanisms  could  be  responsible  for  the  decreased\\nimpact  of  stress  on  above-ground  productivity  under  future  climate\\nconditions?  We  have  examined  three  possible  explanations.  Firstly,\\na  future  climate  could  affect  drought  intensity  or  the  availability  of\\nN  and  Zn.  Secondly,  a  future  climate  could  alter  the  uptake  of  N,\\nZn  and  water  by  stimulating  root  production  and  thirdly,  a  future\\nclimate  could  affect  the  ability  of  plants  to  cope  with  stress  through\\nchanges  in  plant  metabolism.\\nThe  ﬁrst  mechanism  affects  exposure  to  stress  through  changes\\nin  the  availability  of  N,  Zn  or  water.  Plant  Zn  concentrations  were\\nnot  altered  by  climate.  Zinc  concentrations  found  in  plant  mate-\\nrial  are  a  good  indicator  for  metal  bioavailability  in  the  soil;  hence\\nit  is  safe  to  assume  that  Zn  availability  did  not  differ  between  cli-\\nmates  in  our  study  (Maiz  et  al.,  2000;  Van  den  Berge  et  al.,  2011a ).\\nIf  water  could  explain  the  smaller  stress  impact  on  above-ground\\nbiomass  in  the  future  climate  in  drought  stressed  communities,  we\\nwould  expect  higher  water  availability  than  in  the  current  climate.\\nThis  was  not  the  case;  we  found  that  SWC  was  lower  in  the  future\\nclimate  throughout  the  entire  experiment.  The  plant  N  stock  in\\nour  study  did  not  differ  between  climates,  suggesting  no  change156  K.  Naudts  et  al.  /  Environmental  and  Experimental  Botany  99  (2014)  150–158\\nin  N  availability  in  a  future  climate.  However,  the  fact  that  the  P-\\nvalue  of  the  interaction  between  climate  and  stress  in  the  N  limited\\ncommunities  was  close  to  0.05  (0.082)  (see  Section  3.1)  suggests\\nthat  we  cannot  completely  rule  out  changes  in  N  availability  as  an\\nexplanation  for  the  altered  biomass  response  to  stress.  Moreover,\\nan  earlier  study  by  Van  den  Berge  et  al.  (2011b)  revealed  a  mod-\\niﬁed  relation  between  added  N  and  plant  available  N  in  a  future\\nclimate,  potentially  contributing  to  an  altered  biomass  response  to\\nN  limitation.\\nThe  second  potential  mechanism  also  operates  via  changes  in\\nexposure  to  stress  and  hinges  on  altered  root  production.  Stim-\\nulated  root  production  in  a  future  climate  could  change  N,  Zn\\nand  water  uptake.  This  would  moderate  effects  of  N  limitation\\nand  drought,  but  could  intensify  Zn  toxicity.  In  previous  studies,\\nan  increased  root/shoot  ratio  under  elevated  CO 2concentrations\\nincreased  drought  tolerance  by  improving  water  and  nutrient\\nexploration  (Rogers  et  al.,  1994;  Erice  et  al.,  2006 ).  In  the  present\\nstudy,  a future climate  did  indeed  enhance  root  production  in\\nunstressed  communities,  but  this  stimulation  was  lost  under  stress.\\nHence, an altered  uptake  of  N,  Zn  or  water  due  to  an  altered  root  pro-\\nduction  is  unlikely  to  explain  the  above-ground  biomass  response.\\nDifferences in exposure  to  stress  due  to  altered  availability  or\\nuptake  of  Zn  and  water  were  thus  unlikely  to  explain  the  altered\\nbiomass response under  future  climate  conditions.  In  the  speciﬁc\\ncase  of  N  limitation,  an  altered  availability  could  not  be  excluded.\\nHowever,  this  does  not  eliminate  the  possibility  of  a  simultaneous\\nincrease  in  protection  through  changes  in  plant  metabolism,  which\\nis  the  third  mechanism  we  explored.  Therefore,  we  analyzed  C\\nallocation  to  starch  and  cell  wall  material  (IS),  as  well  as  plant\\nantioxidant  responses.\\nThe  positive  stress  impact  values  of  IS  in  a  current  climate\\nindicate  that  plants  responded  to  stress  by  incorporating  more\\nC  into  structural  carbohydrates.  In  contrast,  plants  in  the  future\\nclimate  did  not  exhibit  such  increased  C  allocation  to  storage\\nor  structural  elements  (stress  impact  values  around  0)  upon\\nstress.  Converting  sugars  to  storage  and  structural  materials  may\\nat  ﬁrst  seem  a  beneﬁcial  response  upon  stress  exposure,  but\\nretaining  higher  amounts  of  soluble  sugars  could  enhance  stress\\nprotection.  Soluble  sugars  have  been  found  to  assist  in  osmotic\\nadjustments (Tarczynski  et  al.,  1993 ),  membrane  and  protein  sta-\\nbilization  (Amiard  et  al.,  2003;  Hincha  et  al.,  2003 ),  and  can  have\\na  signalling  function  in  regulating  stress  and  defence  responses\\n(Gomez-Ariza  et  al.,  2007 ).  Moreover,  an  increasing  number  of  stud-\\nies  indicate  that  sugar  and  sugar-like  compounds  can  act  as  ROS\\nscavengers,  working  in  concert  with  vacuolar  phenolic  compounds\\nand  the  ‘classic’  cytosolic  antioxidant  mechanisms  (Nishizawa  et  al.,\\n2008;  Peshev  et  al.,  2013 ).  Our  results  suggest  that  future  climate\\nconditions  affect  the  stress-induced  changes  in  sugar  metabolism,\\nwhich  could  potentially  explain  an  enhanced  protective  capacity.\\nFurther  analysis  of  metabolite  levels  and  sugar  dynamics  is  neces-\\nsary  to  understand  these  metabolic  changes  and  to  elucidate  the\\nimportance  of  this  response  in  stress  protection  under  future  cli-\\nmate  conditions.\\nIncreased  levels  of  enzymatic  and  molecular  antioxidants  are\\noften  associated  to  stress  tolerance  (Mittler,  2002;  Le  Martret\\net  al.,  2011 ).  A  key  explanation  for  the  reduced  stress  impact  on\\nplant  biomass  production  that  we  observed,  was  therefore  found\\nin  the  increased  levels  of  several  small  molecular  antioxidants  in\\nthe  future  climate-grown  plants.  Increases  in  TAC  and  polyphe-\\nnol  levels  were  observed  for  unstressed  and  stressed  communities,\\nindicating  that  future  climate  improves  the  protective  capacity  of\\nplant  communities.  Higher  antioxidant  levels  probably  protected\\nplant  metabolism  against  oxidative  stress  impact  and  contributed\\nto  the  smaller  reduction  in  above-ground  biomass  in  the  future\\nclimate treatment.  The  improved  protective  capacity  could  be\\nexplained  by  an  increased  capacity  for  detoxiﬁcation  and  repairthrough  an  increased  internal  availability  of  C  under  elevated  CO 2\\n(Carlson  and  Bazzaz,  1982 ).\\nIncreases  in  other  antioxidants,  ASC  and  GSH,  and  in  the  ASC\\nredox  status  were  only  apparent  in  the  unstressed  communities.\\nThe  stress  impact  values  for  ASC  and  GSH  levels  and  ASC  redox\\nstatus  were  positive  in  the  current  climate,  but  zero  to  negative  in\\nthe  future  climate.  These  results  are  consistent  with  the  idea  that\\nthese  antioxidants  were  ‘more  effectively  consumed’  by  the  plants\\ngrown  in  a  future  climate,  supporting  their  role  in  protection  and\\ncontinued  growth.  The  difference  in  response  to  stress  conditions\\nfor  ASC,  GSH  (not  increased)  and  TAC  (increased),  is  not  a  surprise,\\nas  ASC  and  GSH  represent  only  a  fraction  of  the  TAC,  and  therefore\\nnot  necessarily  show  the  same  pattern.\\nComprehensive  analyses  of  plant  stress  responses,  at  various\\nlevels  of  organization,  under  different  climate  conditions,  provide\\ncrucial  information  to  predict  future  ecosystem  functioning.  Since\\nit  is  unfeasible  to  test  all  possible  stressors  in  a  realistic  exper-\\nimental  set-up, a mechanistic  understanding  of  stress  responses\\nin  a  future  climate  is  highly  important.  Reports  on  multiple  stress\\nresponses under combined  elevated  CO 2and  warming,  containing\\nbiochemical  as  well  as  ecological  response  variables  are  very  rare.\\nAlso, studies on  the  single  effects  of  elevated  CO 2on  antioxidant\\nmetabolism  remain  inconclusive  (Tausz  et  al.,  2007 ).  A  reduction  in\\nROS formation under  elevated  CO 2can  lead  to  a  down-regulation\\nof  the  protective  systems  in  plants  (Schwanz  and  Polle,  1998;  Vurro\\net  al.,  2009;  Gillespie  et  al.,  2011 ),  but  other  studies  have  found  an\\nenhanced  protective  capacity  (Schwanz  and  Polle,  2001;  Geissler\\net  al.,  2010 )  or  even  an  increase  in  oxidative  stress  (Qiu  et  al.,  2008 ).\\nOne  other  experiment  tackling  the  effect  of  climate  on  drought\\nstress,  did  not  show  an  increased  protective  effect  of  future  cli-\\nmate  at  the  antioxidant  level,  which  was  in  line  with  the  absence\\nof  an  effect  of  future  climate  at  the  biomass  level  (Farfan-Vignolo\\nand  Asard,  2012 ).  This  discrepancy  with  our  ﬁndings  indicates  that\\nthe  protective  effect  of  future  climate  –  at  the  biochemical  and\\ntherefore  also  at  the  biomass  level  –  is  highly  dependent  on  the\\ntiming,  intensity  and  duration  of  the  stressor.  In  a  study  on  the  com-\\nbined  effects  of  elevated  CO 2,  warming  and  drought  on  regrowth\\nof  Medicago  sativa  L.  30  days  after  cutting,  a  smaller  reduction\\nin  regrowth  was  found  in  future  than  in  current  climate  (Erice\\net al.,  2007 ).  With  regard  to  concentrations  of  antioxidant  metabo-\\nlites  (ASC  and  GSH)  there  was  no  effect  of  climate  in  unstressed\\ncommunities,  while  in  stressed  communities  the  future  climate\\ncaused  an  up-regulation  of  GSH  (Erice  et  al.,  2007 ).  In  our  study\\nwe  found  an  up-regulation  in  both  the  ASC  and  GSH  levels  in  a\\nfuture  climate  in  unstressed,  but  not  in  stressed  communities.  We\\nhypothesize  that  the  up-regulation  of  antioxidants  in  a  future  cli-\\nmate  is  explained  by  an  increased  availability  of  substrates  for  their\\nsynthesis.  However,  the  mechanistic  understanding  of  the  effect  of\\na  future  climate  on  antioxidant  metabolism  should  be  the  subject  of\\nfurther  research.  We  therefore  suggest  a  more  extensive  study  that\\nincludes  the  determination  of  additional  biochemical  parameters\\nrelated  to  plant  defence  mechanisms  including  proline  biosynthe-\\nsis,  sugar  dynamics,  changes  in  osmolyte  levels,  and  the  analysis  of\\nplant  antioxidant  enzymes.\\nIn  conclusion,  we  can  conﬁrm  the  hypothesis  that  a  future\\nclimate  ameliorates  plant  protection  against  stress.  Under  stress,\\nplants  grown  in  a  future  climate  had  a  smaller  reduction  in  above-\\nground  biomass  production  than  plants  grown  in  current  climate.\\nOur  results  indicate  three  mutually  non-exclusive  explanations  for\\nthis  response:  (i)  TAC  and  polyphenol  levels  indicate  a  better  pro-\\ntection  against  stress,  (ii)  ASC  and  GSH  are  more  efﬁciently  used\\nas  antioxidants,  and  (iii)  changes  in  sugar  metabolism  provide  an\\nenhanced  stress  protection  in  future  climate.  Most  notably  about\\nour  ﬁndings  is  the  striking  consistency  of  the  protective  effect\\nof future  climate  across  seven  stress  treatments.
