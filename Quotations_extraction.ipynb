He first became interested in his major field, genetics, in the house of the geneticist Adriano Buzzati at Belluno, in the hills north of Venice. There he helped to collect thousands of flies in search of mutant Y chromosomes; and though he subsequently travelled the world to study the makeup of its tribes and populations, it was in Belluno that he died.He had vaguely meant to be a doctor, but found his training useless in wartime hospitals. Instead, he took up the genetic study of E. coli bacteria, shutting himself away in the laboratory. But human beings still fascinated him: not least because he increasingly realised that the human genome contained not only the instructions for building future members of the species, but also its entire past. Migration, conquest and isolation had also left their traces in living populations. He set out to find them.The technology available was rudimentary. He pored over names in parish registers and learned to do statistics, convinced that with enough patience he could measure anything. For one early paper he pulled surnames from Italian phone directories as proxies for father-son transmission. By plotting the distribution of names in 91 provinces, he showed that the Apennines\\u2014the backbone of Italy\\u2014had formed a natural barrier to migration for millennia, resulting in genetically distinct populations on either side. And because he could also measure variation in blood proteins, such as that between A, B and O blood types, he also collected blood samples from townsfolk all over the Parma valley to show that marriage between related individuals had led to many of the genetic differences between those towns.For two decades from 1970, when he took up a professorship at Stanford, he devoted himself to this subject. By the 1990s he was able to study variation in DNA itself. When he and his colleagues instructed a computer to sort around 1,000 people from across the globe into five clusters by similarity of DNA, the clusters matched the labels by which humans had long grouped themselves intuitively: West Eurasians, East Asians, Native Americans, New Guineans and Africans. He soon concluded, though, that race was not a scientifically valid way to classify them. Europeans, for example, were about two-thirds Asian and one-third African, but after millennia of mixing there was no such thing as pure Asian or pure African either. Skin colour, or the shape of a nose, were just superficial adaptations to climate and place.He represented his genetic data as \\u201ctrees\\u201d branching over time: simplistic diagrams, but beautiful in their simplicity. They often agreed, as he had hoped, with the findings of linguists and archaeologists: suggesting, for example, that humanity arose in Africa, where it stayed for a long time before moving outwards, somewhere between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago. The earliest African migrants probably reached Asia first, moving on to Oceania, Europe and America, in that order.He particularly liked to tell his story of farmers. By checking variations between individuals based on their blood groups, he discerned a gradient in that variation that stretched south-east-to-north-west across Europe. This he saw as the genetic signature of farming after its invention around 9,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent. As early farmers radiated out of the Near East, he argued, they bred with indigenous hunter-gatherers, until by the time they reached colder climates their genes were a good mix of both.This theory stood until the 2000s, when new technology reversed it. He had often carped about the public\\u2019s interest in fossils, so much less informative\\u2014to him\\u2014than genetic studies of the living. Once DNA could be extracted from ancient bones, however, it showed that although agriculture had indeed reached Europe from the Middle East, a wave of immigration from the north-east, starting about 5,000 years ago, had diluted those first farmers with tall herdsmen from the Pontic Steppe. People had moved and mixed in prehistory more than he thought; and not all ancient events, as he supposed, had left their mark in modern populations.Even more controversial was his Human Genome Diversity Project, which he set up in the 1990s. He wanted to study isolated populations in order to understand where all the others came from; to measure the background of drift, or genetic change, that takes place without marauding or migration. Some people thought this racist, and a more worldly man might have realised that. A few critics even brought up his membership of Benito Mussolini\\u2019s fascist youth organisation, compulsory before the war. All this dismayed him, as he had done so much to strike down \\u201cscientific\\u201d studies based on race. The project died in its original form, though it was resurrected as the Genographic Project, which goes on.From Belluno he witnessed the overturning of many other conclusions. Every evolutionary story he had touched became more complex by the day. Yet he could comfort himself that without his original vision for the study of human history through its genes, much of that great debate would not have happened at all.\",\n          \"T HE FIRST outbreak of a novel disease is the opening scene of a whodunnit. In 1976, when more than two dozen members of the American Legion died after a convention in Philadelphia, public-health officials spent months scouring the hotel they had met in before finally tracking down the culprit in the water tank on the roof: a new bacterium which, having caused the first known cases of Legionnaires\\u2019 disease, was named Legionella. In the 1980s it took years of hard work and acrimonious argument among epidemiologists and virologists to blame the terrible and varied symptoms of AIDS on HIV, a virus of a type never previously seen in humans.For covid-19, the mystery was solved almost as soon as it had begun. The novel pneumonia that doctors in Wuhan noticed in December 2019 immediately brought to mind Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a disease caused by a coronavirus which broke out in 2002. As a result of SARS and the subsequent outbreak in 2012 of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), also caused by a coronavirus, there were already established protocols for growing cells from the lining of the nose, throat and lungs in order to look for coronavirus infection. They were soon put to use.To identify the possible coronavirus responsible meant producing a sequence of its genome. The first step in this process was to extract RNA\\u2014the molecule on which coronavirus genomes are written\\u2014from the cell cultures. The genetic sequences in these RNA molecules then had to be transcribed into complementary bits of DNA, because that is what automated sequencing machines work with (see part A of diagram).Computer programs assembled the sequences those machines produced into a recognisable, if gappy, coronavirus genome. Researchers used this to make DNA \\u201cprimers\\u201d with which to fish out the not-yet-sequenced bits of the genome. Finished sequences were published less than two weeks after the process had begun. On January 12th 2020 the world knew its enemy\\u2014soon thereafter named SARS-CoV-2\\u2014down to the last letter of its genome.In terms of the science done, this was all routine; the appropriate use of standard laboratory techniques. In terms of its impact, it was enormous. Knowing the viral sequence was fundamental to vaccination efforts, made it possible to track the virus\\u2019s evolution and, most immediately, made it possible to test people with a cough and see if they were infected. The first AIDS tests were not available until four years after medical science became aware of the condition they tested for. For SARS it took six months. Procedures for testing swabs from the nose and throat for RNA from SARS-CoV-2 were published 11 days after the genome sequence, on January 23rd.There was, however, a drawback to the tests. They required suitably equipped laboratories. Most countries did not have nearly enough of the relevant lab capacity; in others, much of it was being used for different things. \\u201cPrior to March 23rd my lab had never performed a viral diagnostic,\\u201d says Stacey Gabriel, who runs genetic-sequencing operations at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts. But with public institutions swamped she and her colleagues created one of the largest testing shops on America\\u2019s east coast from scratch, reconfiguring the specialised robots that populate one of the world\\u2019s most advanced cancer-genetics labs to do the grunt work.Dr Gabriel learned two lessons in the process. The first is that uniformity matters a lot. The Broad started off testing samples from Massachusetts nursing homes which came in containers of varying size and with various amounts of liquid, some accompanied by handwritten forms, some by barcodes. Dealing with such messiness is no task for a robot, and so to begin with just a few thousand samples a day passed through machines capable of handling far more. The second is that you need software to track the whole process. Commercial software, dry swabs and barcoding soon had the lab firing on all cylinders. By March 2021 it could handle 200,000 tests a day and was serving customers as far afield as New York.The data such labs produce are not just for patients and doctors. In most countries covid-19 is a notifiable disease; the authorities have a legal right to know who has been found to be infected. When a sample tests positive the lab has to pass the identity of the person it came from on to public-health officials. At that point a new sort of detective work begins: where did that person\\u2014the index case, in public-health speak\\u2014pick up the virus? To whom might they have given it?Several East Asian countries demonstrated that, if started in the earliest days of an epidemic and pursued with vigour and persistence, such contact tracing can be a powerful tool. Some, such as Singapore and Taiwan, benefited in this from their experience with SARS in the mid-2000s; tracing systems set in place back then were put to use with an urgency born of experience. A level of invasiveness from which most Western authorities shied away was often employed. In South Korea, for instance, contact tracers were able to download a list of all financial transactions made by those who tested positive; they could then obtain CCTV footage from shops the index case had visited in search of other customers to check up on. \\u201c[Such snooping] has come up with discussions I\\u2019ve had with policymakers,\\u201d says Christophe Fraser, a digital epidemiologist at the University of Oxford. \\u201cWe got very hung up on the idea of contact tracing disrupting people\\u2019s lives.\\u201dWestern governments acted in a slower, less thoroughgoing way. They failed to track the initial spread, in part because of insufficient testing capacity (and, in America, dud tests from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention). They ended up with much less impressive systems. Tom Frieden, a former director of the CDC, says he thinks that, at its current level of effort, America could plausibly trace about 15,000 cases a day\\u2014a level that has been handsomely exceeded every day since April 2nd 2020. Britain has earmarked \\u00a337bn for testing and tracing over the 2020 and 2021 financial years, and though it may well spend less, the shoddiness that has dogged some elements of the campaign, such as a database cock-up which lost thousands of results in September 2020, will be remembered.A basic problem is that contact tracing is a lot of work. Theoretical assessments based on analysing social networks and experience in Asia both suggest that some 30 contacts need to be identified for each index case. Digital tools can lessen the load. Resolve to Save Lives, a campaign run by Vital Strategies, an NGO, developed Locator, which taps into credit data to help tracers track down people who may have caught the virus from a specific index case. But the amount of work required remained enormous.A much discussed alternative to such programmes was to use the world\\u2019s most ubiquitous tracking devices: smartphones. Google and Apple worked together to develop a system which enabled phones to keep a list of occasions when they were near another phone for a significant period of time, and the identity of that second phone. When someone tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 they are asked to send a message from their phone which is used to notify all the other phones they had been near within a particular window of time. But everything is peer-to-peer; neither the big tech companies nor the public-health authorities get a list of contacts.Unfortunately this built-in privacy makes it hard to assess the technology\\u2019s efficacy. British and Swiss studies suggest such apps do reduce spread, but not enough to make them more than an also-ran technology. None of the successful contact-tracing systems in East Asia relies on such things to any significant extent.Even without good tracing, self isolation of those who tested positive helped slow the spread of the disease. But over time the shortcomings of the initial testing technology, reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), became ever more apparent. It is conceptually elegant (see diagram) and easy for labs to use. But despite its familiarity, reliability and sensitivity, it has real disadvantages.One is that it needs labs, and is carried out most efficiently in big ones. This means samples may have to travel a long way. It also means that they can get held in queues. The Broad runs its RT-PCR tests in just three and a half hours; but the average sample takes 15 hours to process. Results from RT-PCR tests normally come in days not minutes.Another problem is that though the presence of viral RNA clearly shows that a person has been infected, it says very little about where they stand in the course of the disease; RNA is detectible from very soon after infection to long after the disease has run its course. In public-health terms what is needed is a test that spots people who are actually infectious\\u2014people with cells in their noses and throats actively churning out virus particles.To look for the SARS-CoV-2 particles themselves means looking for their distinctive protein components, not for the RNA that tells cells how to make them. The most detectible such component is the spike protein which studs the particles\\u2019 outer membranes. And one of the basic rules of modern biotechnology is that when you want to find a protein, use an antibody.Antibodies are large molecules that come in millions of varieties, each of which sticks to one target\\u2014known as that antibody\\u2019s \\u201cantigen\\u201d\\u2014and one target only. A handy technology called lateral-flow testing makes use of that specificity. A sample is placed at one end of a porous membrane and, as it seeps along to the other, encounters a line of antibodies designed to recognise it. When the sample is urine and the antigen is a hormone found in expectant women, you have a pregnancy test. When the sample is mucus from a swab and the antigen is the spike protein, it is a covid-19 test\\u2014a cheap, convenient one which can provide results with in half an hour. Such tests may not pick up all the people in whom RT-PCR might detect a trace of the virus. But if their nose and throat cells are not producing enough antigen for the test to detect, they are probably not producing enough to be infectious, either.At the beginning of the epidemic \\u201cthe supply chain for the lateral-flow tests wasn\\u2019t there,\\u201d says Dr Gabriel. Chris Hand, the chairman of Abingdon Health, a British contract manufacturer of lateral-flow tests, says the main bottleneck was the speciality membranes that are part of every test kit. \\u201cThey come on large reels of 100 metres plus, which go through automated equipment to add biochemicals by spraying them at low volumes,\\u201d he says. But once the biochemicals\\u2014the bespoke antibodies and some more generic bits and bobs\\u2014are ready, the production processes in place and the packaging sorted, the tests could be churned out by the million.New technologies now reaching the market will further change the dynamics of test and trace. QuantuMDx is one of a number of companies developing automated PCR-in-a-box systems that provide results within a couple of hours. Jonathan O\\u2019Halloran, the firm\\u2019s boss, says the British company has been relying on its own testing system for the past 22 weeks, testing its 90 staff members every morning (they are free to decline). About once a week lunchtime brings the news that someone has tested positive; they are immediately sent home to isolate. When things are done this fast, the fact that RNA is detectable before people are infectious is a plus; isolating on the basis of an early PCR test means no one ever turns up to work infectious. The company claims not to have lost a single day to infection.A combination of local, automated PCR and lateral-flow tests could be the basis of an ideal testing system\\u2014one which has a chance of keeping ahead of, and containing, a low level of disease rather than lagging behind one that is shooting up. Antigen tests would be used to scan the population for new infections. Those found would be referred to contact tracers; contacts who might have been infected could then be PCR-tested to find out which of them actually were.Great for public health. No benefit, in itself, to the index cases who would wait, isolated, to see what fate the virus and their immune systems had in store for them\\u2014painfully aware that their next encounter with the wonders of modern medical technology could be in a hospital bed. \\u25a0\",\n          \"FOR decades scientists have been trying to understand schizophrenia, a distressing disorder that afflicts one in a hundred people. Its destructive symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, muddled thoughts and changes in behaviour. The best drugs offer little more than the ability to target symptoms. There is presently no hope of a cure because its ultimate cause has long been a mystery.Schizophrenia is known to run in families, so it has always been thought that genes might shed light on the origins of the disease. But the genetics have proved harder to unpick than anyone imagined. It is only now, 16 years after the human genome was first sequenced, that scientists have homed in on the relevant genes.For more than five years researchers led by a group at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, collected more than 100,000 DNA samples from around the world. They were looking for regions of the human genome that might be harbouring variants that increased the risk of schizophrenia. What they found implicated more than a hundred genes and provided a strong pointer towards a portion of the genome associated with infectious diseases. Many of these genes did not operate independently of each other, and further detective work revealed that the most important source of variation lay within a particular gene known as C4.Steven McCarroll, of Harvard Medical School, and his colleagues involved in the study, report in Nature this week that particular forms of the C4 gene led to a greater risk of developing schizophrenia. What makes C4 hard to identify is that it comes in many different forms and has an intriguing function. The gene produces a protein known as a complement factor, which helps to tag pathogens for removal by the body\\u2019s immune system. In the brain, however, it appears to be tied to a developmental process known as \\u201csynaptic pruning\\u201d, in which neurons are continuously eliminated throughout childhood and into early adulthood.In other words schizophrenics may be producing too much of a protein that creates a signal that synaptic connections should be removed. During late adolescence the brain undergoes widespread synaptic pruning, particularly in the cerebral cortex. This is also the age at which schizophrenia symptoms tend to begin.David Goldstein, director of the Institute for Genomic Medicine at Columbia University, says he is persuaded by the research, but reckons it is important for the medical community to examine the study carefully because the region of the genome under discussion is hard to work on and is \\u201cstuffed full of genetic variation\\u201d. That makes it difficult to point to a single gene and say \\u201cit\\u2019s this\\u201d, he adds.As to whether those with a family history of schizophrenia ought to have their genome sequenced to assess their susceptibility, Dr Goldstein is keen to point out that more work needs to be done on the risks that different forms of the genes bring. Moreover, other factors can be implicated in developing schizophrenia, ranging from taking psychoactive drugs to being exposed to viruses while in the womb.Synaptic pruning is so crucial in brain development researchers wonder what other mental disorders might be tied to its aberrant activation or regulation. This study is bound to initiate a flurry of similar work. Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, for one, has been tied to, among other things, excessive destruction of synapses. And it is already believed that autistic individuals have a surplus of synapses in the brain, due to a slowdown in normal brain pruning. Indeed, the onset of autism often follows a period when there is a burst of synapse formation. One big step forward in schizophrenia research could have an enormous impact on the way other neurological disorders are viewed and treated.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 961,\n

instructions for building future members of the species but also its entire past migration conquest and isolation had also left their traces in living populations he set out to find themthe technology available was rudimentary he pored over names in parish registers and learned to do statistics convinced that with enough patience he could measure anything for one early paper he pulled surnames from italian phone directories as proxies for fatherson transmission by plotting the distribution of names in 91 provinces he showed that the apennines the backbone of italy had formed a natural barrier to migration for millennia resulting in genetically distinct populations on either side and because he could also measure variation in blood proteins such as that between a b and o blood types he also collected blood samples from townsfolk all over the parma valley to show that marriage between related individuals had led to many of the genetic differences between those townsfor two decades from 1970 when he took up a professorship at stanford he devoted himself to this subject by the 1990s he was able to study variation in dna itself when he and his colleagues instructed a computer to sort around 1000 people from across the globe into five clusters by similarity of dna the clusters matched the labels by which humans had long grouped themselves intuitively  west eurasians east asians native americans new guineans and africans he soon concluded though that race was not a scientifically valid way to classify them europeans for example were about twothirds asian and onethird african but after millennia of mixing there was no such thing as pure asian or pure african either skin colour or the shape of a nose were just superficial adaptations to climate and placehe represented his genetic data as  trees  branching over time  simplistic diagrams but beautiful in their simplicity they often agreed as he had hoped with the findings of linguists and archaeologists  suggesting for example that humanity arose in africa where it stayed for a long time before moving outwards somewhere between 100000 and 50000 years ago the earliest african migrants probably reached asia first moving on to oceania europe and america in that orderhe particularly liked to tell his story of farmers by checking variations between individuals based on their blood groups he discerned a gradient in that variation that stretched southeasttonorthwest across europe this he saw as the genetic signature of farming after its invention around 9000 years ago in the fertile crescent as early farmers radiated out of the near east he argued they bred with indigenous huntergatherers until by the time they reached colder climates their genes were a good mix of boththis theory stood until the 2000s when new technology reversed it he had often carped about the public s interest in fossils so much less informative to him than genetic studies of the living once dna could be extracted from ancient bones however it showed that although agriculture had indeed reached europe from the middle east a wave of immigration from the northeast starting about 5000 years ago had diluted those first farmers with tall herdsmen from the pontic steppe people had moved and mixed in prehistory more than he thought  and not all ancient events as he supposed had left their mark in modern populationseven more controversial was his human genome diversity project which he set up in the 1990s he wanted to study isolated populations in order to understand where all the others came from  to measure the background of drift or genetic change that takes place without marauding or migration some people thought this racist and a more worldly man might have realised that a few critics even brought up his membership of benito mussolini s fascist youth organisation compulsory before the war all this dismayed him as he had done so much to strike down  scientific  studies based on race the project died in its original form though it was resurrected as the genographic project which goes onfrom belluno he witnessed the overturning of many other conclusions every evolutionary story he had touched became more complex by the day yet he could comfort himself that without his original vision for the study of human history through its genes much of that great debate would not have happened at all\",\n          \"t he first outbreak of a novel disease is the opening scene of a whodunnit in 1976 when more than two dozen members of the american legion died after a convention in philadelphia publichealth officials spent months scouring the hotel they had met in before finally tracking down the culprit in the water tank on the roof  a new bacterium which having caused the first known cases of legionnaires  disease was named legionella in the 1980s it took years of hard work and acrimonious argument among epidemiologists and virologists to blame the terrible and varied symptoms of aids on hiv a virus of a type never previously seen in humansfor covid19 the mystery was solved almost as soon as it had begun the novel pneumonia that doctors in wuhan noticed in december 2019 immediately brought to mind severe acute respiratory syndrome sars a disease caused by a coronavirus which broke out in 2002 as a result of sars and the subsequent outbreak in 2012 of middle east respiratory syndrome mers also caused by a coronavirus there were already established protocols for growing cells from the lining of the nose throat and lungs in order to look for coronavirus infection they were soon put to useto identify the possible coronavirus responsible meant producing a sequence of its genome the first step in this process was to extract rna the molecule on which coronavirus genomes are written from the cell cultures the genetic sequences in these rna molecules then had to be transcribed into complementary bits of dna because that is what automated sequencing machines work with see part a of diagramcomputer programs assembled the sequences those machines produced into a recognisable if gappy coronavirus genome researchers used this to make dna  primers  with which to fish out the notyetsequenced bits of the genome finished sequences were published less than two weeks after the process had begun on january 12th 2020 the world knew its enemy soon thereafter named sarscov2 down to the last letter of its genomein terms of the science done this was all routine  the appropriate use of standard laboratory techniques in terms of its impact it was enormous knowing the viral sequence was fundamental to vaccination efforts made it possible to track the virus s evolution and most immediately made it possible to test people with a cough and see if they were infected the first aids tests were not available until four years after medical science became aware of the condition they tested for for sars it took six months procedures for testing swabs from the nose and throat for rna from sarscov2 were published 11 days after the genome sequence on january 23rdthere was however a drawback to the tests they required suitably equipped laboratories most countries did not have nearly enough of the relevant lab capacity  in others much of it was being used for different things  prior to march 23rd my lab had never performed a viral diagnostic  says stacey gabriel who runs geneticsequencing operations at the broad institute in cambridge massachusetts but with public institutions swamped she and her colleagues created one of the largest testing shops on america s east coast from scratch reconfiguring the specialised robots that populate one of the world s most advanced cancergenetics labs to do the grunt workdr gabriel learned two lessons in the process the first is that uniformity matters a lot the broad started off testing samples from massachusetts nursing homes which came in containers of varying size and with various amounts of liquid some accompanied by handwritten forms some by barcodes dealing with such messiness is no task for a robot and so to begin with just a few thousand samples a day passed through machines capable of handling far more the second is that you need software to track the whole process commercial software dry swabs and barcoding soon had the lab firing on all cylinders by march 2021 it could handle 200000 tests a day and was serving customers as far afield as new yorkthe data such labs produce are not just for patients and doctors in most countries covid19 is a notifiable disease  the authorities have a legal right to know who has been found to be infected when a sample tests positive the lab has to pass the identity of the person it came from on to publichealth officials at that point a new sort of detective work begins  where did that person the index case in publichealth speak pick up the virus to whom might they have given itseveral east asian countries demonstrated that if started in the earliest days of an epidemic and pursued with vigour and persistence such contact tracing can be a powerful tool some such as singapore and taiwan benefited in this from their experience with sars in the mid2000s  tracing systems set in place back then were put to use with an urgency born of experience a level of invasiveness from which most western authorities shied away was often employed in south korea for instance contact tracers were able to download a list of all financial transactions made by those who tested positive  they could then obtain cctv footage from shops the index case had visited in search of other customers to check up on   such snooping  has come up with discussions i ve had with policymakers  says christophe fraser a digital epidemiologist at the university of oxford  we got very hung up on the idea of contact tracing disrupting people s lives western governments acted in a slower less thoroughgoing way they failed to track the initial spread in part because of insufficient testing capacity and in america dud tests from the centres for disease control and prevention they ended up with much less impressive systems tom frieden a former director of the cdc says he thinks that at its current level of effort america could plausibly trace about 15000 cases a day a level that has been handsomely exceeded every day since april 2nd 2020 britain has earmarked  37bn for testing and tracing over the 2020 and 2021 financial years and though it may well spend less the shoddiness that has dogged some elements of the campaign such as a database cockup which lost thousands of results in september 2020 will be remembereda basic problem is that contact tracing is a lot of work theoretical assessments based on analysing social networks and experience in asia both suggest that some 30 contacts need to be identified for each index case digital tools can lessen the load resolve to save lives a campaign run by vital strategies an ngo developed locator which taps into credit data to help tracers track down people who may have caught the virus from a specific index case but the amount of work required remained enormousa much discussed alternative to such programmes was to use the world s most ubiquitous tracking devices  smartphones google and apple worked together to develop a system which enabled phones to keep a list of occasions when they were near another phone for a significant period of time and the identity of that second phone when someone tests positive for sarscov2 they are asked to send a message from their phone which is used to notify all the other phones they had been near within a particular window of time but everything is peertopeer  neither the big tech companies nor the publichealth authorities get a list of contactsunfortunately this builtin privacy makes it hard to assess the technology s efficacy british and swiss studies suggest such apps do reduce spread but not enough to make them more than an alsoran technology none of the successful contacttracing systems in east asia relies on such things to any significant extenteven without good tracing self isolation of those who tested positive helped slow the spread of the disease but over time the shortcomings of the initial testing technology reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction rtpcr became ever more apparent it is conceptually elegant see diagram and easy for labs to use but despite its familiarity reliability and sensitivity it has real disadvantagesone is that it needs labs and is carried out most efficiently in big ones this means samples may have to travel a long way it also means that they can get held in queues the broad runs its rtpcr tests in just three and a half hours  but the average sample takes 15 hours to process results from rtpcr tests normally come in days not minutesanother problem is that though the presence of viral rna clearly shows that a person has been infected it says very little about where they stand in the course of the disease  rna is detectible from very soon after infection to long after the disease has run its course in publichealth terms what is needed is a test that spots people who are actually infectious people with cells in their noses and throats actively churning out virus particlesto look for the sarscov2 particles themselves means looking for their distinctive protein components not for the rna that tells cells how to make them the most detectible such component is the spike protein which studs the particles  outer membranes and one of the basic rules of modern biotechnology is that when you want to find a protein use an antibodyantibodies are large molecules that come in millions of varieties each of which sticks to one target known as that antibody s  antigen  and one target only a handy technology called lateralflow testing makes use of that specificity a sample is placed at one end of a porous membrane and as it seeps along to the other encounters a line of antibodies designed to recognise it when the sample is urine and the antigen is a hormone found in expectant women you have a pregnancy test when the sample is mucus from a swab and the antigen is the spike protein it is a covid19 test a cheap convenient one which can provide results with in half an hour such tests may not pick up all the people in whom rtpcr might detect a trace of the virus but if their nose and throat cells are not producing enough antigen for the test to detect they are probably not producing enough to be infectious eitherat the beginning of the epidemic  the supply chain for the lateralflow tests wasn t there  says dr gabriel chris hand the chairman of abingdon health a british contract manufacturer of lateralflow tests says the main bottleneck was the speciality membranes that are part of every test kit  they come on large reels of 100 metres plus which go through automated equipment to add biochemicals by spraying them at low volumes  he says but once the biochemicals the bespoke antibodies and some more generic bits and bobs are ready the production processes in place and the packaging sorted the tests could be churned out by the millionnew technologies now reaching the market will further change the dynamics of test and trace quantumdx is one of a number of companies developing automated pcrinabox systems that provide results within a couple of hours jonathan o halloran the firm s boss says the british company has been relying on its own testing system for the past 22 weeks testing its 90 staff members every morning they are free to decline about once a week lunchtime brings the news that someone has tested positive  they are immediately sent home to isolate when things are done this fast the fact that rna is detectable before people are infectious is a plus  isolating on the basis of an early pcr test means no one ever turns up to work infectious the company claims not to have lost a single day to infectiona combination of local automated pcr and lateralflow tests could be the basis of an ideal testing system one which has a chance of keeping ahead of and containing a low level of disease rather than lagging behind one that is shooting up antigen tests would be used to scan the population for new infections those found would be referred to contact tracers  contacts who might have been infected could then be pcrtested to find out which of them actually weregreat for public health no benefit in itself to the index cases who would wait isolated to see what fate the virus and their immune systems had in store for them painfully aware that their next encounter with the wonders of modern medical technology could be in a hospital bed  \",\n          \"for decades scientists have been trying to understand schizophrenia a distressing disorder that afflicts one in a hundred people its destructive symptoms include hallucinations delusions muddled thoughts and changes in behaviour the best drugs offer little more than the ability to target symptoms there is presently no hope of a cure because its ultimate cause has long been a mysteryschizophrenia is known to run in families so it has always been thought that genes might shed light on the origins of the disease but the genetics have proved harder to unpick than anyone imagined it is only now 16 years after the human genome was first sequenced that scientists have homed in on the relevant genesfor more than five years researchers led by a group at the broad institute in cambridge massachusetts collected more than 100000 dna samples from around the world they were looking for regions of the human genome that might be harbouring variants that increased the risk of schizophrenia what they found implicated more than a hundred genes and provided a strong pointer towards a portion of the genome associated with infectious diseases many of these genes did not operate independently of each other and further detective work revealed that the most important source of variation lay within a particular gene known as c4steven mccarroll of harvard medical school and his colleagues involved in the study report in nature this week that particular forms of the c4 gene led to a greater risk of developing schizophrenia what makes c4 hard to identify is that it comes in many different forms and has an intriguing function the gene produces a protein known as a complement factor which helps to tag pathogens for removal by the body s immune system in the brain however it appears to be tied to a developmental process known as  synaptic pruning  in which neurons are continuously eliminated throughout childhood and into early adulthoodin other words schizophrenics may be producing too much of a protein that creates a signal that synaptic connections should be removed during late adolescence the brain undergoes widespread synaptic pruning particularly in the cerebral cortex this is also the age at which schizophrenia symptoms tend to begindavid goldstein director of the institute for genomic medicine at columbia university says he is persuaded by the research but reckons it is important for the medical community to examine the study carefully because the region of the genome under discussion is hard to work on and is  stuffed full of genetic variation  that makes it difficult to point to a single gene and say  it s this  he addsas to whether those with a family history of schizophrenia ought to have their genome sequenced to assess their susceptibility dr goldstein is keen to point out that more work needs to be done on the risks that different forms of the genes bring moreover other factors can be implicated in developing schizophrenia ranging from taking psychoactive drugs to being exposed to viruses while in the wombsynaptic pruning is so crucial in brain development researchers wonder what other mental disorders might be tied to its aberrant activation or regulation this study is bound to initiate a flurry of similar work alzheimer s disease for one has been tied to among other things excessive destruction of synapses and it is already believed that autistic individuals have a surplus of synapses in the brain due to a slowdown in normal brain pruning indeed the onset of autism often follows a period when there is a burst of synapse formation one big step

              "\"BridgemanNATURE is full of surprises. When atoms were first proved to exist (and that was a mere century ago), they were thought to be made only of electrons and protons. That explained a lot, but it did not quite square with other observations. Then, in 1932, James Chadwick discovered the neutron. Suddenly everything made sense—so much sense that it took only another 13 years to build an atomic bomb.It is probably no exaggeration to say that biology is now undergoing its “neutron moment”. For more than half a century the fundamental story of living things has been a tale of the interplay between genes, in the form of DNA, and proteins, which the genes encode and which do the donkey work of keeping living organisms living. The past couple of years, however, have seen the rise and rise of a third type of molecule, called RNA. The analogy is not perfect. Unlike the neutron, RNA has been known about for a long time. Until the past couple of years, however, its role had seemed restricted to fetching and carrying for DNA and proteins. Now RNA looks every bit as important as those two masters. It may, indeed, be the main regulator of what goes on in a cell—the cell's operating system, to draw a computing analogy—as well as the author of many other activities (see article). As important, molecular biologists have gone from thinking that they know roughly what is going on in their subject to suddenly realising that they have barely a clue.That might sound a step backwards; in fact, it is how science works. The analogy with physics is deeper than just that between RNA and the neutron. There is in biology at the moment a sense of barely contained expectations reminiscent of the physical sciences at the beginning of the 20th century. It is a feeling of advancing into the unknown, and that where this advance will lead is both exciting and mysterious.As Samuel Goldwyn so wisely advised, never make predictions—especially about the future. But here is one: the analogy between 20th-century physics and 21st-century biology will continue, for both good and ill. Physics gave two things to the 20th century. The most obvious gift was power over nature. That power was not always benign, as the atomic bomb showed. But if the 20th century was distinguished by anything from its predecessors, that distinctive feature was physical technology, from motor cars and aeroplanes to computers and the internet. It is too early to be sure if the distinguishing feature of the 21st century will be biological technology, but there is a good chance that it will be. Simple genetic engineering is now routine; indeed, the first patent application for an artificial living organism has recently been filed (see article). Both the idea of such an organism and the idea that someone might own the rights to it would have been science fiction even a decade ago. And it is not merely that such things are now possible. The other driving force of technological change—necessity—is also there. Many of the big problems facing humanity are biological, or are susceptible to biological intervention. The question of how to deal with an ageing population is one example. Climate change, too, is intimately bound up with biology since it is the result of carbon dioxide going into the air faster than plants can remove it. And the risk of a new, lethal infection suddenly becoming pandemic as a result of modern transport links (see article) is as biological as it gets. Even the fact that such an infection might itself be the result of synthetic biology only emphasises the biological nature of future risks.At the moment, policymakers have inadequate technological tools to deal with these questions. But it is not hard to imagine such tools. Ageing is directly biological. It probably cannot be stopped, but knowing how cells work—really knowing—will allow the process to be transformed for the better. At least part of the answer to climate change is fuel that grows, rather than fuel that is dug up. Only biotechnology can create that. And infections, pandemic or otherwise, are best dealt with by vaccines, which take a long time to develop. If cells were truly understood, that process might speed up to the point where the vaccine was ready in time to do something useful. But physics gave the 20th century a more subtle boon than mere power. It also brought an understanding of the vastness of the universe and humanity's insignificant place in it. It allowed people, in William Blake's phrase, to hold infinity in the palm of a hand, and eternity in an hour.Biology, though, does more than describe humanity's place in the universe. It describes humanity itself. And here, surprisingly, the rise of RNA may be an important part of that description. Ever since the human-genome project was completed, it has puzzled biologists that animals, be they worms, flies or people, all seem to have about the same number of genes for proteins—around 20,000. Yet flies are more complex than worms, and people are more complex than either. Traditional genes are thus not as important as proponents of human nature had suspected nor as proponents of nurture had feared. Instead, the solution to the puzzle seems to lie in the RNA operating system of the cells. This gets bigger with each advance in complexity. And it is noticeably different in a human from that in the brain of a chimpanzee.If RNA is controlling the complexity of the whole organism, that suggests the operating system of each cell is not only running the cell in question, but is linking up with those of the other cells when a creature is developing. To push the analogy, organs such as the brain are the result of a biological internet. If that is right, the search for the essence of humanity has been looking in the wrong genetic direction.Of course, such results are speculative and primitive. But that is the point. Lord Rutherford, who proved that atoms exist, knew nothing of neutrons. Chadwick knew nothing of quarks, let alone supersymmetry. Modern biologists are equally ignorant. But eventually, the truth will out.\""

Even the fact that such an infection might itself be the result of synthetic biology only emphasises the biological nature of future risks.At the moment, policymakers have inadequate technological tools to deal with these questions. But it is not hard to imagine such tools. Ageing is directly biological. It probably cannot be stopped, but knowing how cells work—really knowing—will allow the process to be transformed for the better. At least part of the answer to climate change is fuel that grows, rather than fuel that is dug up. Only biotechnology can create that.

              "'Sir James Chadwick,  (20 October 1891 – 24 July 1974) was an English physicist who was awarded the 1935 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the neutron in 1932. In 1941, he wrote the final draft of the MAUD Report, which inspired the U.S. government to begin serious atom bomb research efforts. He was the head of the British team that worked on the Manhattan Project during World War II. He was knighted in Britain in 1945 for his achievements in physics.\\nChadwick graduated from the Victoria University of Manchester in 1911, where he studied under Ernest Rutherford (known as the \"father of nuclear physics\"). At Manchester, he continued to study under Rutherford until he was awarded his MSc in 1913. The same year, Chadwick was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851. He elected to study beta radiation under Hans Geiger in Berlin. Using Geiger\\'s recently developed Geiger counter, Chadwick was able to demonstrate that beta radiation produced a continuous spectrum, and not discrete lines as had been thought. Still in Germany when World War I broke out in Europe, he spent the next four years in the Ruhleben internment camp.\\nAfter the war, Chadwick followed Rutherford to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where Chadwick earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree under Rutherford\\'s supervision from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in June 1921. He was Rutherford\\'s assistant director of research at the Cavendish Laboratory for over a decade at a time when it was one of the world\\'s foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like John Cockcroft, Norman Feather, and Mark Oliphant. Chadwick followed his discovery of the neutron by measuring its mass. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major weapon in the fight against cancer. Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the University of Liverpool, where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by installing a cyclotron, made it an important centre for the study of nuclear physics.\\nDuring the Second World War, Chadwick carried out research as part of the Tube Alloys project to build an atom bomb, while his Manchester lab and environs were harassed by Luftwaffe bombing. When the Quebec Agreement merged his project with the American Manhattan Project, he became part of the British Mission, and worked at the Los Alamos Laboratory and in Washington, D.C. He surprised everyone by earning the almost-complete trust of project director Leslie R. Groves, Jr. For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1945. In July 1945, he viewed the Trinity nuclear test. After this, he served as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. Uncomfortable with the trend toward Big Science, he became the Master of Gonville and Caius College in 1948. He retired in 1959.\\n\\n\\n== Education and early life ==\\nJames Chadwick was born in Bollington, Cheshire, on 20 October 1891, the first child of John Joseph Chadwick, a cotton spinner, and Anne Mary Knowles, a domestic servant. He was named James after his paternal grandfather. In 1895, his parents moved to Manchester, leaving him in the care of his maternal grandparents. He went to Bollington Cross Primary School, and was offered a scholarship to Manchester Grammar School, which his family had to turn down as they could not afford the small fees that still had to be paid. Instead he attended the Central Grammar School for Boys in Manchester, rejoining his parents there. He now had two younger brothers, Harry and Hubert; a sister had died in infancy. At the age of 16, he sat two examinations for university scholarships, and won both of them.Chadwick chose to attend Victoria University of Manchester, which he entered in 1908. He meant to study mathematics, but enrolled in physics by mistake. Like most students, he lived at home, walking the 4 miles (6.4 km) to the university and back each day. At the end of his first year, he was awarded a Heginbottom Scholarship to study physics. The physics department was headed by Ernest Rutherford, who assigned research projects to final-year students, and he instructed Chadwick to devise a means of comparing the amount of radioactive energy of two different sources. The idea was that they could be measured in terms of the activity of 1 gram (0.035 oz) of radium, a unit of measurement which would become known as the curie. Rutherford\\'s suggested approach was unworkable—something Chadwick knew but was afraid to tell Rutherford—so Chadwick pressed on, and eventually devised the required method. The results became Chadwick\\'s first paper, which, co-authored with Rutherford, was published in 1912. He graduated with first class honours in 1911.Having devised a means of measuring gamma radiation, Chadwick proceeded to measure the absorption of gamma rays by various gases and liquids. This time the resulting paper was published under his name alone. He was awarded his Master of Science (MSc) degree in 1912, and was appointed a Beyer Fellow. The following year he was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship, which allowed him to study and research at a university in continental Europe. He elected to go to the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt in Berlin in 1913, to study beta radiation under Hans Geiger. Using Geiger\\'s recently developed Geiger counter, which provided more accuracy than the earlier photographic techniques, he was able to demonstrate that beta radiation did not produce discrete lines, as has been previously thought, but rather a continuous spectrum with peaks in certain regions. On a visit to Geiger\\'s laboratory, Albert Einstein told Chadwick that: \"I can explain either of these things, but I can\\'t explain them both at the same time.\" The continuous spectrum would remain an unexplained phenomenon for many years.Chadwick was still in Germany at the start of the First World War, and was interned in the Ruhleben internment camp near Berlin, where he was allowed to set up a laboratory in the stables and conduct scientific experiments using improvised materials such as radioactive toothpaste. With the help of Charles Drummond Ellis, he worked on the ionisation of phosphorus, and the photochemical reaction of carbon monoxide and chlorine. He was released after the Armistice with Germany came into effect in November 1918, and returned to his parents\\' home in Manchester, where he wrote up his findings over the previous four years for the 1851 Exhibition commissioners.Rutherford gave Chadwick a part-time teaching position at Manchester, allowing him to continue research. He looked at the nuclear charge of platinum, silver, and copper, and experimentally found that this was the same as the atomic number within an error of less than 1.5 per cent. In April 1919, Rutherford became director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, and Chadwick joined him there a few months later. Chadwick was awarded a Clerk-Maxwell studentship in 1920, and enrolled as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) student at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. The first half of his thesis was his work with atomic numbers. In the second, he looked at the forces inside the nucleus. His degree was awarded in June 1921. In November, he became a Fellow of Gonville and Caius College.\\n\\n\\n== Researcher ==\\n\\n\\n=== Cambridge ===\\nChadwick\\'s Clerk-Maxwell studentship expired in 1923, and he was succeeded by the Russian physicist Pyotr Kapitza. The Chairman of the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Sir William McCormick arranged for Chadwick to become Rutherford\\'s assistant director of research. In this role, Chadwick helped Rutherford select PhD students. Over the next few years these would include John Cockcroft, Norman Feather and Mark Oliphant, who would become firm friends with Chadwick. As many students had no idea what they wanted to research, Rutherford and Chadwick would suggest topics. Chadwick edited all the papers produced by the laboratory.\\nIn 1925, Chadwick met Aileen Stewart-Brown, the daughter of a Liverpool stockbroker. The two were married in August 1925, with Kapitza as Best Man. The couple had twin daughters, Joanna and Judith, who were born in February 1927.In his research, Chadwick continued to probe the nucleus. In 1925, the concept of spin had allowed physicists to explain the Zeeman effect, but it also created unexplained anomalies. At the time it was believed that the nucleus consisted of protons and electrons, so nitrogen\\'s nucleus, for example, with a mass number of 14, was assumed to contain 14 protons and 7 electrons. This gave it the right mass and charge, but the wrong spin.At a conference at Cambridge on beta particles and gamma rays in 1928, Chadwick met Geiger again. Geiger had brought with him a new model of his Geiger counter, which had been improved by his post-doctoral student Walther Müller. Chadwick had not used one since the war, and the new Geiger–Müller counter was potentially a major improvement over the scintillation techniques then in use at Cambridge, which relied on the human eye for observation. The major drawback with it was that it detected alpha, beta and gamma radiation, and radium, which the Cavendish laboratory normally used in its experiments, emitted all three, and was therefore unsuitable for what Chadwick had in mind. However, polonium is an alpha emitter, and Lise Meitner sent Chadwick about 2 millicuries (about 0.5 μg) from Germany.In Germany, Walther Bothe and his student Herbert Becker had used polonium to bombard beryllium with alpha particles, producing an unusual form of radiation. Chadwick had his Australian 1851 Exhibition scholar, Hugh Webster, duplicate their results. To Chadwick, this was evidence of something that he and Rutherford had been hypothesising for years: the neutron, a theoretical nuclear particle with no electric charge. Then in January 1932, Feather drew Chadwick\\'s attention to another surprising result. Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie had succeeded in knocking protons from paraffin wax using polonium and beryllium as a source for what they thought was gamma radiation. Rutherford and Chadwick disagreed; protons were too heavy for that. But neutrons would need only a small amount of energy to achieve the same effect. In Rome, Ettore Majorana came to the same conclusion: the Joliot-Curies had discovered the neutron but did not know it.\\nChadwick dropped all his other responsibilities to concentrate on proving the existence of the neutron, assisted by Feather and frequently working late at night. He devised a simple apparatus that consisted of a cylinder containing a polonium source and beryllium target. The resulting radiation could then be directed at a material such as paraffin wax.  The displaced particles, which were protons, would go into a small ionisation chamber where they could be detected with an oscilloscope.\\nIn February 1932, after only about two weeks of experimentation with neutrons, Chadwick sent a letter to Nature titled \"Possible Existence of a Neutron\". He communicated his findings in detail in an article sent to Proceedings of the Royal Society A titled \"The Existence of a Neutron\" in May. His discovery of the neutron was a milestone in understanding the nucleus. Reading Chadwick\\'s paper, Robert Bacher and Edward Condon realised that anomalies in the then-current theory, like the spin of nitrogen, would be resolved if the neutron has a spin of 1/2 and that a nitrogen nucleus consisted of seven protons and seven neutrons.The theoretical physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg considered whether the neutron could be a fundamental nuclear particle like the proton and electron, rather than a proton–electron pair.  Heisenberg showed that the neutron was best described as a new nuclear particle, but its exact nature remained unclear.  In his 1933 Bakerian Lecture, Chadwick estimated that a neutron had a mass of about 1.0067 u. Since a proton and an electron had a combined mass of 1.0078 u, this implied the neutron as a proton–electron composite had a binding energy of about 2 MeV, which sounded reasonable, although it was hard to understand how a particle with so little binding energy could be stable.  Estimating such a small mass difference required challenging precise measurements, however, and several conflicting results were obtained in 1933–4.  By bombarding boron with alpha particles, Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie obtained a large value for the mass of a neutron, but Ernest Lawrence\\'s team at the University of California produced a small one.  Then Maurice Goldhaber, a refugee from Nazi Germany and a graduate student at the Cavendish Laboratory, suggested to Chadwick that deuterons could be photodisintegrated by the 2.6 MeV gamma rays of 208Tl (then known as thorium C\"):\\n\\nAn accurate value for the mass of the neutron could be determined from this process. Chadwick and Goldhaber tried this and found that it worked.  They measured the kinetic energy of the proton produced as 1.05 MeV, leaving the mass of the neutron as the unknown in the equation. Chadwick and Goldhaber calculated that it was either 1.0084 or 1.0090 atomic units, depending on the values used for the masses of the proton and deuteron.  (The modern accepted value for the mass of the neutron is 1.00866 u.) The mass of the neutron was too large to be a proton–electron pair.For his discovery of the neutron, Chadwick was awarded the Hughes Medal by the Royal Society in 1932, the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935, the Copley Medal in 1950 and the Franklin Medal in 1951. His discovery of the neutron made it possible to produce elements heavier than uranium in the laboratory by the capture of slow neutrons followed by beta decay. Unlike the positively charged alpha particles, which are repelled by the electrical forces present in the nuclei of other atoms, neutrons do not need to overcome any Coulomb barrier, and can therefore penetrate and enter the nuclei of even the heaviest elements such as uranium. This inspired Enrico Fermi to investigate the nuclear reactions brought about by collisions of nuclei with slow neutrons, work for which Fermi would receive the Nobel Prize in 1938.Wolfgang Pauli proposed another kind of particle on 4 December 1930 to explain the continuous spectrum of beta radiation that Chadwick had reported in 1914. Since not all of the energy of beta radiation could be accounted for, the law of conservation of energy appeared to be violated, but Pauli argued that this could be redressed if another, undiscovered, particle was involved. Pauli also called this particle a neutron, but it was clearly not the same particle as Chadwick\\'s neutron. Fermi renamed it the neutrino, Italian for \"little neutron\". In 1934, Fermi proposed his theory of beta decay which explained that the electrons emitted from the nucleus were created by the decay of a neutron into a proton, an electron, and a neutrino.  The neutrino could account for the missing energy, but a particle with little mass and no electric charge was difficult to observe. Rudolf Peierls and Hans Bethe calculated that neutrinos could easily pass through the Earth, so the chances of detecting them were slim. Frederick Reines and Clyde Cowan would confirm the neutrino on 14 June 1956 by placing a detector within a large antineutrino flux from a nearby nuclear reactor.\\n\\n\\n=== Liverpool ===\\nWith the onset of the Great Depression in the United Kingdom, the government became more parsimonious with funding for science. At the same time, Lawrence\\'s recent invention, the cyclotron, promised to revolutionise experimental nuclear physics, and Chadwick felt that the Cavendish laboratory would fall behind unless it also acquired one. He therefore chafed under Rutherford, who clung to the belief that good nuclear physics could still be done without large, expensive equipment, and turned down the request for a cyclotron.\\nChadwick was himself a critic of Big Science in general, and Lawrence in particular, whose approach he considered careless and focused on technology at the expense of science. When Lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the Solvay Conference in 1933, Chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment. While Lawrence rechecked his results at Berkeley only to find that Chadwick was correct, Rutherford and Oliphant conducted an investigation at the Cavendish that found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3, thereby causing the effect that Lawrence had observed. This was another major discovery, but the Oliphant-Rutherford particle accelerator was an expensive state-of-the-art piece of equipment.In March 1935, Chadwick received an offer of the Lyon Jones Chair of physics at the University of Liverpool, in his wife\\'s home town, to succeed Lionel Wilberforce. The laboratory was so antiquated that it still ran on direct current electricity, but Chadwick seized the opportunity, assuming the chair on 1 October 1935. The university\\'s prestige was soon bolstered by Chadwick\\'s Nobel Prize, which was announced in November 1935. His medal was sold at auction in 2014 for $329,000.Chadwick set about acquiring a cyclotron for Liverpool. He started by spending £700 to refurbish the antiquated laboratories at Liverpool, so some components could be made in-house. He was able to persuade the university to provide £2,000 and obtained a grant for another £2,000 from the Royal Society. To build his cyclotron, Chadwick brought in two young experts, Bernard Kinsey and Harold Walke, who had worked with Lawrence at the University of California. A local cable manufacturer donated the copper conductor for the coils. The cyclotron\\'s 50-ton magnet was manufactured in Trafford Park by Metropolitan-Vickers, which also made the vacuum chamber. The cyclotron was completely installed and running in July 1939. The total cost of £5,184 was more than Chadwick had received from the university and the Royal Society, so Chadwick paid the rest from his 159,917 kr (£8,243) Nobel Prize money.At Liverpool the Medicine and Science faculties worked together closely. Chadwick was automatically a committee member of both faculties, and in 1938 he was appointed to a commission headed by Lord Derby to investigate the arrangements for cancer treatment in Liverpool. Chadwick anticipated that neutrons and radioactive isotopes produced with the 37-inch cyclotron could be used to study biochemical processes, and might become a weapon in the fight against cancer.\\n\\n\\n== Second World War ==\\n\\n\\n=== Tube Alloys and the MAUD Report ===\\nIn Germany, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann bombarded uranium with neutrons, and noted that barium, a lighter element, was among the products produced. Hitherto, only the same or heavier elements had been produced by the process. In January 1939, Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch astounded the physics community with a paper that explained this result. They theorised that uranium atoms bombarded with neutrons can break into two roughly equal fragments, a process they called fission. They calculated that this would result in the release of about 200 MeV, implying an energy release orders of magnitude greater than chemical reactions, and Frisch confirmed their theory experimentally. It was soon noted by Hahn that if neutrons were released during fission, then a chain reaction was possible. French scientists, Pierre Joliot, Hans von Halban and Lew Kowarski, soon verified that more than one neutron was indeed emitted per fission. In a paper co-authored with the American physicist John Wheeler, Bohr theorised that fission was more likely to occur in the uranium-235 isotope, which made up only 0.7 per cent of natural uranium.\\nChadwick did not believe that there was any likelihood of another war with Germany in 1939, and took his family for a holiday on a remote lake in northern Sweden. The news of the outbreak of the Second World War therefore came as a shock. Determined not to spend another war in an internment camp, Chadwick made his way to Stockholm as fast as he could, but when he arrived there with his family, he found that all air traffic between Stockholm and London had been suspended. They made their way back to England on a tramp steamer. When he reached Liverpool, Chadwick found Joseph Rotblat, a Polish post-doctoral fellow who had come to work with the cyclotron, was now destitute, as he was cut off from funds from Poland. Chadwick promptly hired Rotblat as a lecturer, despite his poor grasp of English.In October 1939, Chadwick received a letter from Sir Edward Appleton, the Secretary of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, asking for his opinion on the feasibility of an atom bomb. Chadwick responded cautiously. He did not dismiss the possibility, but carefully went over the many theoretical and practical difficulties involved. Chadwick decided to investigate the properties of uranium oxide further with Rotblat. In March 1940, Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls at the University of Birmingham re-examined the theoretical issues involved in a paper that became known as the Frisch–Peierls memorandum. Instead of looking at unenriched uranium oxide, they considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that not only could a chain reaction occur, but that it might require as little as 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235, and unleash the energy of tons of dynamite.\\nA special subcommittee of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW), known as the MAUD Committee, was created to investigate the matter further. It was chaired by Sir George Thomson and its original membership included Chadwick, along with Mark Oliphant, John Cockcroft and Philip Moon. While other teams investigated uranium enrichment techniques, Chadwick\\'s team at Liverpool concentrated on determining the nuclear cross section of uranium-235. By April 1941, it had been experimentally confirmed that the critical mass of uranium-235 might be 8 kilograms (18 lb) or less. His research into such matters was complicated by all-but-incessant Luftwaffe bombings of the environs of his Liverpool lab; the windows were blown out so often that they were replaced by cardboard.In July 1941, Chadwick was chosen to write the final draft of the MAUD Report, which, when presented by Vannevar Bush to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in October 1941, inspired the U.S. government to pour millions of dollars into the pursuit of an atom bomb. When George B. Pegram and Harold Urey visited Britain to see how the project, now known as Tube Alloys, was going, Chadwick was able to tell them: \"I wish I could tell you that the bomb is not going to work, but I am 90 per cent sure that it will.\"In a recent book about the Bomb project, Graham Farmelo wrote that \"Chadwick did more than any other scientist to give Churchill the Bomb. ... Chadwick was tested almost to the breaking point.\" So worried that he could not sleep, Chadwick resorted to sleeping pills, which he continued to take for most of his remaining years. Chadwick later said that he realised that \"a nuclear bomb was not only possible—it was inevitable. Sooner or later these ideas could not be peculiar to us. Everybody would think about them before long, and some country would put them into action\". Sir Hermann Bondi suggested that it was fortunate that Chadwick, not Rutherford, was the doyen of UK physics at the time, as the latter\\'s prestige might otherwise have overpowered Chadwick\\'s interest in \"looking forward\" to the Bomb\\'s prospects.\\n\\n\\n=== Manhattan Project ===\\nOwing to the danger from aerial bombardment, the Chadwicks sent their twins to Canada as part of a government evacuation scheme. Chadwick was reluctant to move Tube Alloys there, believing that the United Kingdom was a better location for the isotope separation plant. The enormous scope of the effort became more apparent in 1942: even a pilot separation plant would cost over £1 million and strain Britain\\'s resources, to say nothing of a full-scale plant, which was estimated to cost somewhere in the vicinity of £25 million. It would have to be built in America. At the same time that the British became convinced that a joint project was necessary, the progress of the American Manhattan Project was such that British cooperation seemed less essential, although the Americans were still eager to use Chadwick\\'s talents.The matter of cooperation had to be taken up at the highest level. In September 1943, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and President Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which reinstated cooperation between Britain, the United States and Canada. Chadwick, Oliphant, Peierls and Simon were summoned to the United States by the director of Tube Alloys, Sir Wallace Akers, to work with the Manhattan Project. The Quebec Agreement established a new Combined Policy Committee to direct the joint project. The Americans disliked Akers, so Chadwick was appointed technical advisor to the Combined Policy Committee, and the head of the British Mission.Leaving Rotblat in charge in Liverpool, Chadwick began a tour of the Manhattan Project facilities in November 1943, except for the Hanford Site where plutonium was produced, which he was not allowed to see. He became the only man, apart from Groves and his second in command, to have access to all the American research and production facilities for the uranium bomb. Observing the work on the K-25 gaseous diffusion facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Chadwick realised how wrong he had been about building the plant in wartime Britain. The enormous structure could never have been concealed from the Luftwaffe. In early 1944, he moved to Los Alamos, New Mexico, with his wife and their twins, who now spoke with Canadian accents. For security reasons, he was given the cover name of James Chaffee.\\nChadwick accepted that the Americans did not need British help, but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion. Working closely with the director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., he attempted to do everything he could to support the effort. He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which Chadwick was committed. Requests from Groves via Chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys. As a result, the British team was critical to the Project\\'s success.Although he had more knowledge of the project than anyone else from Britain, Chadwick had no access to the Hanford site. Lord Portal was offered a tour of Hanford in 1946. \"This was the only plant to which Chadwick had been denied access in wartime, and now he asked Groves if he could accompany Portal. Groves replied that he could, but if he did then \\'Portal will not see very much\\'.\" For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1945. He considered this to be a recognition of the work of the whole Tube Alloys project.By early 1945, Chadwick was spending most of his time in Washington, D.C., and his family relocated from Los Alamos to a house on Washington\\'s Dupont Circle in April 1945. He was present at the meeting of the Combined Policy Committee on 4 July when Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson gave Britain\\'s agreement to use the atom bomb against Japan, and at the Trinity nuclear test on 16 July, when the first atom bomb was detonated. Inside its pit was a polonium-beryllium modulated neutron initiator, a development of the technique that Chadwick had used to discover the neutron over a decade before. William L. Laurence, The New York Times reporter attached to the Manhattan Project, wrote that \"never before in history had any man lived to see his own discovery materialize itself with such telling effect on the destiny of man.\"\\n\\n\\n== Later life ==\\nShortly after the war ended, Chadwick was appointed to the Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy (ACAE). He was also appointed as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. He clashed with fellow ACAE member Patrick Blackett, who disagreed with Chadwick\\'s conviction that Britain needed to acquire its own nuclear weapons; but it was Chadwick\\'s position that was ultimately adopted. He returned to Britain in 1946, to find a country still beset by wartime rationing and shortages.At this time, Sir James Mountford, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Liverpool, wrote in his diary \"he had never seen a man \\'so physically, mentally and spiritually tired\" as Chadwick, for he \"had plumbed such depths of moral decision as more fortunate men are never called upon even to peer into ... [and suffered] ... almost insupportable agonies of responsibility arising from his scientific work\\'.\"In 1948, Chadwick accepted an offer to become the Master of Gonville and Caius College. The job was prestigious but ill-defined; the Master was the titular head of the college, but authority actually resided in a council of 13 fellows, of whom one was the Master. As Master, Chadwick strove to improve the academic reputation of the college. He increased the number of research fellowships from 31 to 49, and sought to bring talent into the college. This involved controversial decisions, such as hiring in 1951 the Chinese biochemist Tien-chin Tsao and the Hungarian-born economist Peter Bauer. In what became known as the Peasants\\' Revolt, fellows led by Patrick Hadley voted an old friend of Chadwick\\'s off the council and replaced him with Bauer. More friends of Chadwick\\'s were removed over the following years, and he retired in November 1958. It was during his mastership that Francis Crick, a PhD student at Gonville and Caius College, and James Watson discovered the structure of DNA.By the 1970s Chadwick became more frail, and seldom left his flat, although he travelled to Liverpool for celebrations of his eightieth birthday. A lifelong atheist, he saw no reason to adopt religious faith in later life. He died in his sleep on 24 July 1974.\\n\\n\\n== Honours ==\\nElected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1927.\\nMedal for Merit from the United States,\\nPour le Mérite from Germany.\\nForeign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1946\\nInternational member of the American Philosophical Society in 1948.\\nMember of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1970 for \"services to science\", and went to Buckingham Palace for the investiture ceremony.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\nChadwick\\'s papers are held at the Churchill Archives Centre in Cambridge, and are accessible to the public.\\nThe Chadwick Laboratory at the University of Liverpool.\\nSir James Chadwick Chair of Experimental Physics, also at the University of Liverpool.

              "\"SOME are born great. Some achieve greatness. Some have greatness thrust upon them. Substitute “fame” for “greatness” and you have an updated version of Shakespeare's quip that applies nicely to this year's Nobel prize for medicine, which was awarded for the development of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). The born-famous was Louise Brown, the world's first test-tube baby. The achiever of fame, celebrated at the time in newspapers and on television, was Patrick Steptoe, the gynecologist who created Ms Brown in his laboratory in 1978. And the man who has had fame thrust upon him, a mere 32 years after the event, is Robert Edwards, who spent more than two decades developing the science that IVF relies on. Dr Edwards was honoured for this work by the Karolinska Institute, on October 4th (though the prize will not actually be handed over until December). Steptoe died in 1988, and prizes are not awarded posthumously, so Dr Edwards scoops the whole pool of SKr10m ($1.5m).Dr Edwards began his work on mice, before moving to people. He gradually worked out how human eggs mature to the point where they can be fertilised, but had little success getting such fertilised eggs to develop into embryos that could be implanted into women, in order that they could grow into children.The breakthrough came when he teamed up with Steptoe, who was working on the then-novel technique of laparoscopy (keyhole surgery). Dr Edwards realised that laparoscopy could be used to extract eggs from women's ovaries in reasonably large numbers (until then, he had been relying on more intrusive surgical methods to obtain them). This, combined with hormone injections to bring those eggs to the correct state of maturity before they were removed, meant that women who were infertile because their Fallopian tubes were blocked might have eggs extracted, fertilised outside their bodies by sperm from the man of their choice, and the embryos that resulted implanted into their wombs—thus bypassing the Fallopian blockage.Ms Brown was the result—and the first of what are now reckoned to be 4m people born as a consequence of IVF. At the time, though, the technique was controversial. Steptoe and Dr Edwards were accused of playing God, being like Victor Frankenstein and so on. A lesson, perhaps, for those who have similar knee-jerk reactions to things like human cloning.PS Here is our take on this year's physics prize. Or should that be chemistry?\""

              "'The Origins of Creativity. By Edward Wilson. Liveright; 198 pages; $24.95. Allen Lane; £20.The Runaway Species. By Anthony Brandt and David Eagleman. Catapult; 287 pages; $28. Canongate; £20.DOES science spoil beauty? John Keats, an English Romantic poet, thought so. When Sir Isaac Newton separated white light into its prismatic colours, the effect, Keats wrote, was to “unweave a rainbow”. By explaining how rainbows occurred, the mystery and the lustre were lost. The idea that science and the arts are distinct, incompatible cultures is an enduring one. Two new books seem to cut to the heart of the matter: human creativity.Edward Wilson, 88 and the author of “The Origins of Creativity”, is the grand old man of Harvard biology. His speciality is myrmecology—the study of ants. For a short book, “The Origins of Creativity” is brimming with ideas, many of which wander, as Mr Wilson’s writing often does, beyond the brief of the title. Ultimately, though, everything in the book ties back to genetics and evolution—and a belief that culture and creativity have genetic roots.Mr Wilson traces the source of creativity to human prehistory, on the African savannah. Man’s ancestors were, for a time, dull, relatively asocial vegetarians. The crucial step, Mr Wilson argues, came with the switch to eating meat. This meant having to hunt in groups, and that meant becoming more social: people had to co-operate in the foray, and share the rewards. This change put an evolutionary premium on communication and social intelligence. Eventually, by way of natural selection, it gave rise to symbolic language. And thus the birth of the humanities came about, in storytelling and the “nocturnal firelight of the earliest human encampments”.This version of events is relatively straightforward. More controversial is where Mr Wilson tries to take the reader next. In his eyes the humanities today are static and blinkered, hamstrung by their failure to acknowledge their evolutionary roots. The salvation of the humanities, he argues, lies in the “Big Five”: palaeontology, anthropology, psychology, evolutionary biology and neurobiology. By studying these different areas, scientists will be able to connect aesthetics and cultural evolution to the underlying genetic evolution that explains them. Thus Mr Wilson would expand the mantra of Theodosius Dobzhansky, a great geneticist: “Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution” to “Nothing in science and the humanities makes sense except in the light of evolution.”Where Mr Wilson focuses on the origins of creativity, Anthony Brandt and David Eagleman, a composer and a neuroscientist, focus in “The Runaway Species” on the act of creation. The book makes a single argument, clearly and thoroughly: creativity is never the creation of something from nothing. Instead, consciously or not, people refashion things. They do this for the most part in three ways: by bending, breaking and blending. Bending involves taking something and altering a property. Breaking involves taking a whole apart and assembling something new from the fragments. And blending involves mixing multiple sources together in new ways.“The Runaway Species” is not short of examples. For breaking, the authors cite Cubism, shotgun sequencing of DNA and photomontage in film. For blending, the minotaur and the mermaid, genetic splicing and creole languages. And for bending, the authors point to the artificial heart. At first, scientists copied the heart as closely as they could, beating and all. But beating led to wear and tear—and was unnecessary, as the heart simply needs to pump blood. Today transplant patients are given continuous-flow hearts. (It turns out that Dick Cheney, who had a heart transplant at the age of 71, has not had a heartbeat since 2010.)In a way, Keats was right: applying scientific scrutiny to the arts runs the risk of feeling like an autopsy. Both these books, though, skirt around that danger. Messrs Wilson and Eagleman themselves are both scientists and novelists—living embodiments of the fallacy that there are two distinct cultures. Both “The Origins of Creativity” and “The Runaway Species” approach creativity scientifically but sensitively, feeling its roots without pulling them out.'"

              "'John Keats (31 October 1795 – 23 February 1821) was an English poet of the second generation of Romantic poets, along with Lord Byron and Percy Bysshe Shelley. His poems had been in publication for less than four years when he died of tuberculosis at the age of 25. They were indifferently received in his lifetime, but his fame grew rapidly after his death. By the end of the century, he was placed in the canon of English literature, strongly influencing many writers of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood; the Encyclopædia Britannica of 1888 called one ode \"one of the final masterpieces\". Jorge Luis Borges named his first time reading Keats an experience he felt all his life. Keats had a style \"heavily loaded with sensualities\", notably in the series of odes. Typically of the Romantics, he accentuated extreme emotion through natural imagery. Today his poems and letters remain among the most popular and analysed in English literature – in particular \"Ode to a Nightingale\", \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\", \"Sleep and Poetry\" and the sonnet \"On First Looking into Chapman\\'s Homer\".\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education, 1795–1810 ==\\nJohn Keats was born in Moorgate, London, on 31 October 1795, to Thomas and Frances Keats (née Jennings). There is little evidence of his exact birthplace. Although Keats and his family seem to have marked his birthday on 29 October, baptism records give the date as the 31st. He was the eldest of four surviving children; his younger siblings were George (1797–1841), Thomas (1799–1818), and Frances Mary \"Fanny\" (1803–1889), who later married the Spanish author Valentín Llanos Gutiérrez. Another son was lost in infancy. His father first worked as an ostler at the stables attached to the Swan and Hoop Inn owned by his father-in-law, John Jennings, an establishment he later managed, and where the growing family lived for some years. Keats believed he was born at the inn, a birthplace of humble origins, but there is no evidence to support this. The Globe pub now occupies the site (2012), a few yards from modern Moorgate station. Keats was baptised at St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate, and sent to a local dame school as a child.\\nHis parents wished to send their sons to Eton or Harrow, but the family decided they could not afford the fees. In the summer of 1803, John was sent to board at John Clarke\\'s school in Enfield, close to his grandparents\\' house. The small school had a liberal outlook and a progressive curriculum more modern than the larger, more prestigious schools. In the family atmosphere at Clarke\\'s, Keats developed an interest in classics and history, which would stay with him throughout his short life. The headmaster\\'s son, Charles Cowden Clarke, also became an important mentor and friend, introducing Keats to Renaissance literature, including Tasso, Spenser, and Chapman\\'s translations. The young Keats was described by his friend Edward Holmes as a volatile character, \"always in extremes\", given to indolence and fighting. However, at 13 he began focusing his energy on reading and study, winning his first academic prize in midsummer 1809.In April 1804, when Keats was eight, his father died from a skull fracture after falling from his horse while returning from a visit to Keats and his brother George at school. Thomas Keats died intestate. Frances remarried two months later, but left her new husband soon afterwards, and the four children went to live with a grandmother, Alice Jennings, in the village of Edmonton.In March 1810, when Keats was 14, his mother died of tuberculosis, leaving the children in their grandmother\\'s custody. She appointed two guardians, Richard Abbey and John Sandell, for them. That autumn, Keats left Clarke\\'s school to be an apprentice with Thomas Hammond, a surgeon and apothecary who was a neighbour and the doctor of the Jennings family. Keats lodged in the attic above the surgery, at 7 Church Street, until 1813. Cowden Clarke, who remained close to Keats, called this period \"the most placid time in Keats\\' life.\"From 1814 Keats had two bequests, held in trust for him until his 21st birthday. £800 was willed by his grandfather John Jennings. Also Keats\\'s mother left a legacy of £8000 to be equally divided among her living children. It seems he was not told of the £800 and probably knew nothing of it as he never applied for it. Historically, blame has often been laid on Abbey as legal guardian, but he may also have been unaware of it. William Walton, solicitor for Keats\\'s mother and grandmother, definitely knew and had a duty of care to relay the information to Keats. It seems he did not, though it would have made a critical difference to the poet\\'s expectations. Money was always a great concern and difficulty, as he struggled to stay out of debt and make his way in the world independently.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Medical training and writing poetry ===\\n\\nIn October 1815, having finished his five-year apprenticeship with Hammond, Keats registered as a medical student at Guy\\'s Hospital (now part of King\\'s College London) and began studying there. Within a month, he was accepted as a dresser at the hospital assisting surgeons during operations, the equivalent of a junior house surgeon today. It was a significant promotion, that marked a distinct aptitude for medicine; and it brought greater responsibility and a heavier workload. Keats\\'s long and expensive medical training with Hammond and at Guy\\'s Hospital led his family to assume he would pursue a lifelong career in medicine, assuring financial security, and it seems that, at this point, Keats had a genuine desire to become a doctor. He lodged near the hospital, at 28 St Thomas\\'s Street in Southwark, with other medical students, including Henry Stephens who gained fame as an inventor and ink magnate.Keats\\'s training took up increasing amounts of his writing time and he became increasingly ambivalent about it. He felt he was facing a stark choice. He had written his first extant poem, \"An Imitation of Spenser\", in 1814, when he was 19. Now, strongly drawn by ambition, inspired by fellow poets such as Leigh Hunt and Lord Byron, and beleaguered by family financial crises, he suffered periods of depression. His brother George wrote that John \"feared that he should never be a poet, & if he was not he would destroy himself.\" In 1816, Keats received his apothecary\\'s licence, which made him eligible to practise as an apothecary, physician and surgeon, but before the end of the year he had informed his guardian that he resolved to be a poet, not a surgeon.\\n\\n\\n=== Publication and literary circles ===\\nAlthough he continued his work and training at Guy\\'s, Keats devoted more and more time to the study of literature, experimenting with verse forms, particularly the sonnet. In May 1816, Leigh Hunt agreed to publish the sonnet \"O Solitude\" in his magazine The Examiner, a leading liberal magazine of the day. This was the first appearance of Keats\\'s poetry in print; Charles Cowden Clarke called it his friend\\'s red letter day, first proof that Keats\\' ambitions were valid. Among his poems of 1816 was To My Brothers. That summer, Keats went with Clarke to the seaside town of Margate to write. There he began \"Calidore\" and initiated an era of great letter writing. On returning to London, he took lodgings at 8 Dean Street, Southwark, and braced himself to study further for membership of the Royal College of Surgeons.In October 1816 Clarke introduced Keats to the influential Leigh Hunt, a close friend of Byron and Shelley. Five months later came the publication of Poems, the first volume of Keats\\'s verse, which included \"I stood tiptoe\" and \"Sleep and Poetry\", both strongly influenced by Hunt. The book was a critical failure, arousing little interest, although Reynolds reviewed it favourably in The Champion. Clarke commented that the book \"might have emerged in Timbuctoo.\" Keats\\'s publishers, Charles and James Ollier, felt ashamed of it. Keats immediately changed publishers to Taylor and Hessey in Fleet Street. Unlike the Olliers, Keats\\'s new publishers were enthusiastic about his work. Within a month of the publication of Poems they were planning a new Keats volume and had paid him an advance. Hessey became a steady friend to Keats and made the company\\'s rooms available for young writers to meet. Their publishing lists came to include Coleridge, Hazlitt, Clare, Hogg, Carlyle and Charles Lamb.Through Taylor and Hessey, Keats met their Eton-educated lawyer, Richard Woodhouse, who advised them on literary as well as legal matters and was deeply impressed by Poems. Although he noted that Keats could be \"wayward, trembling, easily daunted,\" Woodhouse was convinced of Keats\\'s genius, a poet to support as he became one of England\\'s greatest writers. Soon after they met, the two became close friends, and Woodhouse started to collect Keatsiana, documenting as much as he could about the poetry. This archive survives as one of the main sources of information on Keats\\'s work. Andrew Motion represents him as Boswell to Keats\\'s Johnson, ceaselessly promoting his work, fighting his corner and spurring his poetry to greater heights. In later years, Woodhouse was one of the few to accompany Keats to Gravesend, Kent, to embark on his final trip to Rome.Despite the bad reviews of Poems, Hunt published the essay \"Three Young Poets\" (Shelley, Keats, and Reynolds) and the sonnet \"On First Looking into Chapman\\'s Homer\", foreseeing great things to come. He introduced Keats to many prominent men in his circle, including the editor of The Times, Thomas Barnes; the writer Charles Lamb; the conductor Vincent Novello; and the poet John Hamilton Reynolds, who would become a close friend. Keats also met regularly with William Hazlitt, a powerful literary figure of the day. It was a turning point for Keats, establishing him in the public eye as a figure in what Hunt termed \"a new school of poetry\". At this time Keats wrote to his friend Bailey, \"I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart\\'s affections and the truth of the imagination. What imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth.\" This passage would eventually be transmuted into the concluding lines of \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\": \"\\'Beauty is truth, truth beauty\\' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\". In early December 1816, under the heady influence of his artistic friends, Keats told Abbey he had decided to give up medicine in favour of poetry, to Abbey\\'s fury. Keats had spent a great deal on his medical training, and despite his state of financial hardship and indebtedness, made large loans to friends such as the painter Benjamin Haydon. Keats would go on to lend £700 to his brother George. By lending so much, Keats could no longer cover the interest of his own debts.\\n\\n\\n=== Travelling and ill health ===\\nHaving left his training at the hospital, suffering from a succession of colds, and unhappy with living in damp rooms in London, Keats moved with his brothers into rooms at 1 Well Walk in the village of Hampstead in April 1817. There John and George nursed their tubercular brother Tom. The house was close to Hunt and others of his circle in Hampstead, and to Coleridge, respected elder of the first wave of Romantic poets, then living in Highgate. On 11 April 1818, Keats reported that he and Coleridge had taken a long walk on Hampstead Heath. In a letter to his brother George, he wrote that they had talked about \"a thousand things, ... nightingales, poetry, poetical sensation, metaphysics.\" Around this time he was introduced to Charles Wentworth Dilke and James Rice.In June 1818, Keats began a walking tour of Scotland, Ireland and the Lake District with Charles Armitage Brown. Keats\\'s brother George and his wife Georgiana accompanied them to Lancaster and then continued to Liverpool, from where they migrated to America, living in Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky, until 1841, when George\\'s investments failed. Like Keats\\'s other brother, they both died penniless and racked by tuberculosis, for which there was no effective treatment until the next century. In July, while on the Isle of Mull, Keats caught a bad cold and \"was too thin and fevered to proceed on the journey.\" After returning south in August, Keats continued to nurse Tom, so exposing himself to infection. Some have suggested this was when tuberculosis, his \"family disease\", took hold. \"Consumption\" was not identified as a disease with a single infectious origin until 1820. There was considerable stigma attached to it, as it was often tied with weakness, repressed sexual passion or masturbation. Keats \"refuses to give it a name\" in his letters. Tom Keats died on 1 December 1818.\\n\\n\\n=== Wentworth Place: annus mirabilis ===\\nJohn Keats moved to the newly built Wentworth Place, owned by his friend Charles Armitage Brown. It was on the edge of Hampstead Heath, ten minutes\\' walk south of his old home in Well Walk. The winter of 1818–19, though a difficult period for the poet, marked the beginning of his annus mirabilis in which he wrote his most mature work. He had been inspired by a series of recent lectures by Hazlitt on English poets and poetic identity and had also met Wordsworth. Keats may have seemed to his friends to be living on comfortable means, but in reality he was borrowing regularly from Abbey and his friends.He composed five of his six great odes at Wentworth Place in April and May and, although it is debated in which order they were written, \"Ode to Psyche\" opened the published series. According to Brown, \"Ode to a Nightingale\" was composed under a plum tree in the garden. Brown wrote, \"In the spring of 1819 a nightingale had built her nest near my house. Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song; and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast-table to the grass-plot under a plum-tree, where he sat for two or three hours. When he came into the house, I perceived he had some scraps of paper in his hand, and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books. On inquiry, I found those scraps, four or five in number, contained his poetic feelings on the song of our nightingale.\" Dilke, co-owner of the house, strenuously denied the story, printed in Richard Monckton Milnes\\' 1848 biography of Keats, dismissing it as \\'pure delusion\\'.\\n\\n\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" and \"Ode on Melancholy\" were inspired by sonnet forms and probably written after \"Ode to a Nightingale\". Keats\\'s new and progressive publishers Taylor and Hessey issued Endymion, which Keats dedicated to Thomas Chatterton, a work that he termed \"a trial of my Powers of Imagination\". It was damned by the critics, giving rise to Byron\\'s quip that Keats was ultimately \"snuffed out by an article\", suggesting that he never truly got over it. A particularly harsh review by John Wilson Croker appeared in the April 1818 edition of the Quarterly Review. John Gibson Lockhart writing in Blackwood\\'s Magazine, described Endymion as \"imperturbable drivelling idiocy\". With biting sarcasm, Lockhart advised, \"It is a better and a wiser thing to be a starved apothecary than a starved poet; so back to the shop Mr John, back to plasters, pills, and ointment boxes.\" It was Lockhart at Blackwoods who coined the defamatory term \"the Cockney School\" for Hunt and his circle, which included both Hazlitt and Keats. The dismissal was as much political as literary, aimed at upstart young writers deemed uncouth for their lack of education, non-formal rhyming and \"low diction\". They had not attended Eton, Harrow or Oxbridge and they were not from the upper classes.In 1819 Keats wrote \"The Eve of St. Agnes\", \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\", \"Hyperion\", \"Lamia\" and a play, Otho the Great (critically damned and not performed until 1950). The poems \"Fancy\" and \"Bards of passion and of mirth\" were inspired by the garden of Wentworth Place. In September, very short of money and in despair considering taking up journalism or a post as a ship\\'s surgeon, he approached his publishers with a new book of poems. They were unimpressed with the collection, finding the presented versions of \"Lamia\" confusing, and describing \"St Agnes\" as having a \"sense of pettish disgust\" and \"a \\'Don Juan\\' style of mingling up sentiment and sneering\" concluding it was \"a poem unfit for ladies\". The final volume Keats lived to see, Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems, was eventually published in July 1820. It received greater acclaim than had Endymion or Poems, finding favourable notices in both The Examiner and Edinburgh Review. It would come to be recognised as one of the most important poetic works ever published.Wentworth Place now houses the Keats House museum.\\n\\n\\n=== Isabella Jones and Fanny Brawne, 1817–1820 ===\\n\\nKeats befriended Isabella Jones in May 1817, while on holiday in the village of Bo Peep, near Hastings. She is described as beautiful, talented and widely read, not of the top flight of society yet financially secure, an enigmatic figure who would become a part of Keats\\'s circle. Throughout their friendship Keats never hesitated to own his sexual attraction to her, although they seemed to enjoy circling each other rather than offering commitment. He writes that he \"frequented her rooms\" in the winter of 1818–19, and in his letters to George says that he \"warmed with her\" and \"kissed her\". The trysts may have been a sexual initiation for Keats according to Bate and Robert Gittings. Jones inspired and was a steward of Keats\\'s writing. The themes of \"The Eve of St. Agnes\" and \"The Eve of St Mark\" may well have been suggested by her, the lyric Hush, Hush! [\"o sweet Isabel\"] was about her, and that the first version of \"Bright Star\" may have originally been for her. In 1821, Jones was one of the first in England to be notified of Keats\\'s death.Letters and drafts of poems suggest that Keats first met Frances (Fanny) Brawne between September and November 1818. It is likely that the 18-year-old Brawne visited the Dilke family at Wentworth Place before she lived there. She was born in the hamlet of West End (now in the district of West Hampstead), on 9 August 1800. Like Keats\\'s grandfather, her grandfather kept a London inn, and both lost several family members to tuberculosis. She shared her first name with both Keats\\'s sister and mother, and had a talent for dress-making and languages as well as a natural theatrical bent. During November 1818 she developed an intimacy with Keats, but it was shadowed by the illness of Tom Keats, whom John was nursing through this period.\\nOn 3 April 1819, Brawne and her widowed mother moved into the other half of Dilke\\'s Wentworth Place, and Keats and Brawne were able to see each other every day. Keats began to lend Brawne books, such as Dante\\'s Inferno, and they would read together. He gave her the love sonnet \"Bright Star\" (perhaps revised for her) as a declaration. It was a work in progress which he continued until the last months of his life, and the poem came to be associated with their relationship. \"All his desires were concentrated on Fanny\". From this point there is no further documented mention of Isabella Jones. Sometime before the end of June, he arrived at some sort of understanding with Brawne, far from a formal engagement as he still had too little to offer, with no prospects and financial stricture. Keats endured great conflict knowing his expectations as a struggling poet in increasingly hard straits would preclude marriage to Brawne. Their love remained unconsummated; jealousy for his \\'star\\' began to gnaw at him. Darkness, disease and depression surrounded him, reflected in poems such as \"The Eve of St. Agnes\" and \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\" where love and death both stalk. \"I have two luxuries to brood over in my walks;\" he wrote to her, \"your loveliness, and the hour of my death\".In one of his many hundreds of notes and letters, Keats wrote to Brawne on 13 October 1819: \"My love has made me selfish. I cannot exist without you – I am forgetful of every thing but seeing you again – my Life seems to stop there – I see no further. You have absorb\\'d me. I have a sensation at the present moment as though I was dissolving – I should be exquisitely miserable without the hope of soon seeing you ... I have been astonished that Men could die Martyrs for religion – I have shudder\\'d at it – I shudder no more – I could be martyr\\'d for my Religion – Love is my religion – I could die for that – I could die for you.\"\\nTuberculosis took hold and he was advised by his doctors to move to a warmer climate. In September 1820 Keats left for Rome knowing he would probably never see Brawne again. After leaving he felt unable to write to her or read her letters, although he did correspond with her mother. He died there five months later. None of Brawne\\'s letters to Keats survive.It took a month for the news of his death to reach London, after which Brawne stayed in mourning for six years. In 1833, more than 12 years after his death, she married and went on to have three children; she outlived Keats by more than 40 years.\\n\\n\\n== Last months: Rome, 1820 ==\\nDuring 1820 Keats displayed increasingly serious symptoms of tuberculosis, suffering two lung haemorrhages in the first few days of February. On first coughing up blood, on 3 February 1820, he said to Charles Armitage Brown, \"I know the colour of that blood! It is arterial blood. I cannot be deceived in that colour. That drop of blood is my death warrant. I must die.\"He lost large amounts of blood and was bled further by the attending physician. Hunt nursed him in London for much of the following summer. At the suggestion of his doctors, he agreed to move to Italy with his friend Joseph Severn. On 13 September, they left for Gravesend and four days later boarded the sailing brig Maria Crowther. On 1 October the ship landed at Lulworth Bay or Holworth Bay, where the two went ashore; back on board ship he made the final revisions of \"Bright Star\". The journey was a minor catastrophe: storms broke out, followed by a dead calm that slowed the ship\\'s progress. When they finally docked in Naples, the ship was held in quarantine for ten days due to a suspected outbreak of cholera in Britain. Keats reached Rome on 14 November, by which time any hope of the warmer climate he sought had disappeared.\\nKeats wrote his last letter on 30 November 1820 to Charles Armitage Brown; \"Tis the most difficult thing in the world to me to write a letter. My stomach continues so bad, that I feel it worse on opening any book – yet I am much better than I was in Quarantine. Then I am afraid to encounter the proing and conning of any thing interesting to me in England. I have an habitual feeling of my real life having past, and that I am leading a posthumous existence\".On arrival in Italy, he moved into a villa on the Spanish Steps in Rome, today the Keats–Shelley Memorial House museum. Despite care from Severn and Dr. James Clark, his health rapidly deteriorated. The medical attention Keats received may have hastened his death. In November 1820, Clark declared that the source of his illness was \"mental exertion\" and that the source was largely situated in his stomach. Clark eventually diagnosed consumption (tuberculosis) and placed Keats on a starvation diet of an anchovy and a piece of bread a day intended to reduce the blood flow to his stomach. He also bled the poet: a standard treatment of the day, but also likely a significant contributor to Keats\\'s weakness. Severn\\'s biographer Sue Brown writes: \"They could have used opium in small doses, and Keats had asked Severn to buy a bottle of opium when they were setting off on their voyage. What Severn didn\\'t realise was that Keats saw it as a possible resource if he wanted to commit suicide. He tried to get the bottle from Severn on the voyage but Severn wouldn\\'t let him have it. Then in Rome he tried again.... Severn was in such a quandary he didn\\'t know what to do, so in the end he went to the doctor, who took it away. As a result Keats went through dreadful agonies with nothing to ease the pain at all.\" Keats was angry with both Severn and Clark when they would not give him laudanum (opium). He repeatedly demanded, \"How long is this posthumous existence of mine to go on?\"\\n\\n\\n== Death, 1821 ==\\nThe first months of 1821 marked a slow and steady decline into the final stage of tuberculosis. His autopsy showed his lung almost disintegrated. Keats was coughing up blood and covered in sweat. Severn nursed him devotedly and observed in a letter how Keats would sometimes cry upon waking to find himself still alive. Severn writes,\\n\\nKeats raves till I am in a complete tremble for him... about four, the approaches of death came on. [Keats said] \"Severn – I – lift me up – I am dying – I shall die easy; don\\'t be frightened – be firm, and thank God it has come.\" I lifted him up in my arms. The phlegm seem\\'d boiling in his throat, and increased until eleven, when he gradually sank into death, so quiet, that I still thought he slept.\\nJohn Keats died in Rome on 23 February 1821. His body was buried in the city\\'s Protestant Cemetery. His last request was to be placed under a tombstone bearing no name or date, only the words, \"Here lies One whose Name was writ in Water.\" Severn and Brown erected the stone, which under a relief of a lyre with broken strings, includes the epitaph: \\n\\nThis Grave / contains all that was Mortal, / of a / YOUNG ENGLISH POET, / Who, / on his Death Bed, / in the Bitterness of his Heart, / at the Malicious Power of his Enemies, / Desired / these Words to be engraven on his Tomb Stone / Here lies One / Whose Name was writ in Water / Feb 24th 1821\\nThe text bears an echo from Catullus LXX:\\n\\nSed mulier cupido quod dicit amanti / in vento et rapida scribere oportet aqua (What a woman says to a passionate lover / should be written in the wind and the running water).\\nFrancis Beaumont also used the expression in The Nice Valour, Act 5, scene 5 (? 1616):\\n\\nAll your better deeds / Shall be in water writ, but this in marble.\\nSevern and Brown added their lines to the stone in protest at the critical reception of Keats\\'s work. Hunt blamed his death on the Quarterly Review\\'s scathing attack of \"Endymion\". As Byron quipped in his narrative poem Don Juan;\\n\\nSeven weeks after the funeral, Shelley memorialised Keats in his poem Adonais. Clark saw to a planting of daisies on the grave, saying Keats would have wished it. For public health reasons, the Italian health authorities burnt the furniture in Keats\\'s room, scraped the walls and made new windows, doors and flooring. The ashes of Shelley, one of Keats\\'s most fervent champions, are buried in the cemetery and Joseph Severn is buried next to Keats. On the site today, Marsh wrote, \"In the old part of the graveyard, barely a field when Keats was buried here, there are now umbrella pines, myrtle shrubs, roses, and carpets of wild violets\".\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\nWhen Keats died at 25, he had been writing poetry seriously for only about six years, from 1814 until the summer of 1820, and publishing for only four. In his lifetime, sales of Keats\\'s three volumes of poetry probably amounted to only 200 copies. His first poem, the sonnet O Solitude, appeared in the Examiner in May 1816, while his collection Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes and other poems was published in July 1820 before his last visit to Rome. The compression of his poetic apprenticeship and maturity into so short a time is just one remarkable aspect of Keats\\'s work.Although prolific during his short career, and now one of the most studied and admired British poets, his reputation rests on a small body of work, centred on the Odes, and only in the creative outpouring of the last years of his short life was he able to express the inner intensity for which he has been lauded since his death. Keats was convinced that he had made no mark in his lifetime. Aware that he was dying, he wrote to Fanny Brawne in February 1820, \"I have left no immortal work behind me – nothing to make my friends proud of my memory – but I have lov\\'d the principle of beauty in all things, and if I had had time I would have made myself remember\\'d.\"Keats\\'s ability and talent was acknowledged by several influential contemporary allies such as Shelley and Hunt. His admirers praised him for thinking \"on his pulses\", for having developed a style which was more heavily loaded with sensualities, more gorgeous in its effects, more voluptuously alive than any poet who had come before him: \"loading every rift with ore\". Shelley often corresponded with Keats in Rome and loudly declared that Keats\\'s death had been brought on by bad reviews in the Quarterly Review. Seven weeks after the funeral he wrote Adonais, a despairing elegy, stating that Keats\\'s early death was a personal and public tragedy:\\n\\nAlthough Keats wrote that \"if poetry comes not as naturally as the Leaves to a tree it had better not come at all,\" poetry did not come easily to him; his work was the fruit of a deliberate and prolonged classical self-education. He may have possessed an innate poetic sensibility, but his early works were clearly those of a young man learning his craft. His first attempts at verse were often vague, languorously narcotic and lacking a clear eye. His poetic sense was based on the conventional tastes of his friend Charles Cowden Clarke, who first introduced him to the classics, and also came from the predilections of Hunt\\'s Examiner, which Keats read as a boy. Hunt scorned the Augustan or \"French\" school dominated by Pope and attacked earlier Romantic poets Wordsworth and Coleridge, now in their forties, as unsophisticated, obscure and crude writers. Indeed, during Keats\\'s few years as a published poet, the reputation of the older Romantic school was at its lowest ebb. Keats came to echo these sentiments in his work, identifying himself with a \"new school\" for a time, somewhat alienating him from Wordsworth, Coleridge and Byron and providing a basis for scathing attacks from Blackwood\\'s and the Quarterly Review.\\n\\nBy his death, Keats had therefore been associated with the taints of both old and new schools: the obscurity of first-wave Romantics and uneducated affectation of Hunt\\'s \"Cockney School\". Keats\\'s posthumous reputation mixed the reviewers\\' caricature of the simplistic bumbler with the image of a hyper-sensitive genius killed by high feeling, which Shelley later portrayed.The Victorian sense of poetry as the work of indulgence and luxuriant fancy offered a schema into which Keats was posthumously fitted. Marked as the standard-bearer of sensory writing, his reputation grew steadily and remarkably. His work had the full support of the influential Cambridge Apostles, whose members included the young Tennyson, later a popular Poet Laureate who came to regard Keats as the greatest poet of the 19th century. Constance Naden was a great admirer of his poems, arguing that his genius lay in his \\'exquisite sensitiveness to all the elements of beauty\\'. In 1848, twenty-seven years after Keats\\'s death, Richard Monckton Milnes published the first full biography, which helped place Keats within the canon of English literature. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, including Millais and Rossetti, were inspired by Keats and painted scenes from his poems including \"The Eve of St. Agnes\", \"Isabella\" and \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\", lush, arresting and popular images which remain closely associated with Keats\\'s work.In 1882, Swinburne wrote in the Encyclopædia Britannica that \"the Ode to a Nightingale [was] one of the final masterpieces of human work in all time and for all ages\". In the 20th century Keats remained the muse of poets such as Wilfred Owen, who kept his death date as a day of mourning, Yeats and T. S. Eliot. Critic Helen Vendler stated the odes \"are a group of works in which the English language finds an ultimate embodiment.\" Bate said of To Autumn: \"Each generation has found it one of the most nearly perfect poems in English\" and M. R. Ridley said the ode \"is the most serenely flawless poem in our language.\"The largest collection of the letters, manuscripts, and other papers of Keats is in the Houghton Library at Harvard University. Other collections of material are archived at the British Library, Keats House, Hampstead, the Keats–Shelley Memorial House in Rome and the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York. Since 1998 the British Keats-Shelley Memorial Association have annually awarded a prize for romantic poetry. A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque was unveiled in 1896 to commemorate Keats at Keats House.Jorge Luis Borges named his first encounter with Keats an experience he felt all his life.\\n\\n\\n=== Biographers ===\\nNone of Keats\\'s biographies were written by people who had known him. Shortly after his death, his publishers announced they would speedily publish The memoirs and remains of John Keats but his friends refused to cooperate and argued with each other to such an extent that the project was abandoned. Leigh Hunt\\'s Lord Byron and some of his Contemporaries (1828) gives the first biographical account, strongly emphasising Keats\\'s supposedly humble origins, a misconception which still continues. Given that he was becoming a significant figure within artistic circles, a succession of other publications followed, including anthologies of his many notes, chapters and letters. However, early accounts often gave contradictory or biased versions of events and were subject to dispute. His friends Brown, Severn, Dilke, Shelley and his guardian Richard Abbey, his publisher Taylor, Fanny Brawne and many others issued posthumous commentary on Keats\\'s life. These early writings coloured all subsequent biography and have become embedded in a body of Keats legend.Shelley promoted Keats as someone whose achievement could not be separated from agony, who was \\'spiritualised\\' by his decline and too fine-tuned to endure the harshness of life; the consumptive, suffering image popularly held today. The first full biography was published in 1848 by Richard Monckton Milnes. Landmark Keats biographers since include Sidney Colvin, Robert Gittings, Walter Jackson Bate, Aileen Ward, and Andrew Motion. The idealised image of the heroic romantic poet who battled poverty and died young was inflated by the late arrival of an authoritative biography and the lack of an accurate likeness. Most of the surviving portraits of Keats were painted after his death, and those who knew him held that they did not succeed in capturing his unique quality and intensity.\\n\\n\\n=== Other portrayals ===\\nJohn Keats: His Life and Death, the first major motion picture about the life of Keats, was produced in 1973 by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. It was directed by John Barnes. John Stride played John Keats and Janina Faye played Fanny Brawne. The 2009 film Bright Star, written and directed by Jane Campion, focuses on Keats\\'s relationship with Fanny Brawne. Inspired by the 1997 Keats biography by Andrew Motion, Ben Whishaw played Keats and Abbie Cornish played Fanny.Poet Laureate Simon Armitage wrote \"\\'I speak as someone...\\'\" to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Keats\\'s death. It was first published in The Times on 20 February 2021. In 2007 a sculpture of Keats seated on a bench, by sculptor Stuart Williamson, was unveiled at Guys and Saint Thomas\\' Hospital, London by the Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion.\\n\\n\\n== Letters ==\\nKeats\\'s letters were first published in 1848 and 1878. Critics in the 19th century disregarded them as distractions from his poetic works, but in the 20th century they became almost as admired and studied as his poetry, and are highly regarded in the canon of English literary correspondence. T. S. Eliot called them \"certainly the most notable and most important ever written by any English poet.\" Keats spent much time considering poetry itself, its constructs and impacts, displaying a deep interest unusual in his milieu, who were more easily distracted by metaphysics or politics, fashions or science. Eliot wrote of Keats\\'s conclusions; \"There is hardly one statement of Keats\\' about poetry which... will not be found to be true, and what is more, true for greater and more mature poetry than anything Keats ever wrote.\"Few of Keats\\'s letters remain from the period before he joined his literary circle. From spring 1817, however, there is a rich record of his prolific and impressive letter-writing skills. He and his friends, poets, critics, novelists, and editors wrote to each other daily, and Keats\\'s ideas are bound up in the ordinary, his day-to-day missives sharing news, parody and social commentary. They glitter with humour and critical intelligence. Born of an \"unself-conscious stream of consciousness,\" they are impulsive, full of awareness of his own nature and his weak spots. When his brother George went to America, Keats wrote to him in detail, the body of letters becoming \"the real diary\" and self-revelation of Keats\\'s life, as well as an exposition of his philosophy, with the first drafts of poems containing some of Keats\\'s finest writing and thought. Gittings sees them as akin to a \"spiritual journal\" not written for a specific other, so much as for synthesis.Keats also reflected on the background and composition of his poetry. Specific letters often coincide with or anticipate the poems they describe. In February to May 1819 he produced many of his finest letters. Writing to his brother George, Keats explored the idea of the world as \"the vale of Soul-making\",  anticipating the great odes he wrote some months later. In the letters Keats coined ideas such as the Mansion of Many Apartments and the Chameleon Poet, which came to gain common currency and capture the public imagination, though only making single appearances as phrases in his correspondence. The poetical mind, Keats argued:\\n\\nhas no self – it is every thing and nothing – It has no character – it enjoys light and shade;... What shocks the virtuous philosopher, delights the camelion [chameleon] Poet. It does no harm from its relish of the dark side of things any more than from its taste for the bright one; because they both end in speculation. A Poet is the most unpoetical of any thing in existence; because he has no Identity – he is continually in for – and filling some other Body – The Sun, the Moon, the Sea and Men and Women who are creatures of impulse are poetical and have about them an unchangeable attribute – the poet has none; no identity – he is certainly the most unpoetical of all God\\'s Creatures.\\n\\nHe used the term negative capability to discuss the state of being in which we are \"capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason.... [Being] content with half knowledge\" where one trusts in the heart\\'s perceptions. He wrote later he was \"certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart\\'s affections and the truth of Imagination – What the imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth – whether it existed before or not – for I have the same Idea of all our Passions as of Love they are all in their sublime, creative of essential Beauty\" constantly returning to what it means to be a poet. \"My Imagination is a Monastery and I am its Monk\", Keats notes to Shelley. In September 1819, Keats wrote to Reynolds \"How beautiful the season is now – How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it.... I never lik\\'d the stubbled fields as much as now – Aye, better than the chilly green of spring. Somehow the stubble plain looks warm – in the same way as some pictures look warm – this struck me so much in my Sunday\\'s walk that I composed upon it\". The final stanza of his last great ode, \"To Autumn\", runs:\\n\\n\"To Autumn\" was to become one of the most highly regarded poems in the English language.There are areas of his life and daily routine that Keats omits. He mentions little of his childhood or his financial straits, being seemingly embarrassed to discuss them. There is no reference to his parents. In his last year, as his health deteriorated, his concerns often give way to despair and morbid obsessions. His letters to Fanny Brawne, published in 1870, focus on the period and emphasise its tragic aspect, giving rise to widespread criticism at the time.\\n\\n\\n== Major works ==\\n\\nCox, Jeffrey N., ed.
